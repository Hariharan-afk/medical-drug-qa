Description:
Floxuridine belongs to the group of medicines known as antimetabolites. It is used to treat some kinds of cancer.

Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, like hair loss, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects may not occur for months or years after the medicine is used.

Before you begin treatment with floxuridine, you and your doctor should talk about the good this medicine will do as well as the risks of using it.

If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.
