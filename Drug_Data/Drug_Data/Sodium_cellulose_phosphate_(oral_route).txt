Description:
Cellulose sodium phosphate is used to prevent the formation of calcium-containing kidney stones. It is used in patients whose bodies absorb too much calcium from their food.

Cellulose sodium phosphate works by combining with the calcium and some other minerals in food. This prevents the calcium from reaching the kidneys where the stones are formed.

Cellulose sodium phosphate is available only with your doctor's prescription.

Pediatric:
