Description:
Cinacalcet is used to treat hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease who are on dialysis. Hyperparathyroidism is a condition that is caused when the parathyroid glands located in the neck make too much parathyroid hormone (PTH). This hormone helps to control the concentrations of calcium and phosphorus in your blood.

Cinacalcet lowers the amount of PTH which lowers the calcium and phosphorus concentrations. Cinacalcet is also used to lower calcium in the blood of patients with parathyroid cancer and primary hyperparathyroidism.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
