Description:
Urea C 14 is a radiopharmaceutical. It is used to diagnose stomach ulcers caused by a certain kind of bacteria known as Helicobacter pylori or H. pylori.

This agent is taken by mouth. If any H. pylori bacteria are present in the stomach, they will cause the urea C 14 to be broken down into radioactive carbon dioxide gas. When you breathe out by the mouth, the amount of radioactive carbon dioxide can be measured to see whether the bacteria are in your stomach.

This agent is a radioactive agent. However, with the small amounts in the capsule that is used for the test, the radiation your body receives is very low and is considered safe.

This agent is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor with specialized training in nuclear medicine.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
