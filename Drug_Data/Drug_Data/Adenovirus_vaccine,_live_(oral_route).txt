Precautions:
It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits  to make sure that this vaccine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.

Do not take this vaccine if you are pregnant and do not plan to become pregnant for 6 weeks after receiving this vaccine without first checking with your doctor. There is a chance that this vaccine may cause problems during pregnancy. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant for 6 weeks after receiving the vaccine. If you think you have become pregnant, tell your doctor right away.

This vaccine contains live viruses that are shed in the stool for up to 28 days after receiving the vaccine and can cause disease to other people if transmitted. Your doctor may recommend ways (eg, proper and frequent hand washing, especially right after bowel movements) to help prevent the spread of virus to other people.

You should avoid close contact with people at high risk for catching the adenovirus for 28 days after receiving this vaccine. People who are at risk for catching the virus are pregnant women, children younger than 7 years of age, and anyone who has a weak immune system that keeps them from fighting infections.

This vaccine contains albumin, which comes from human blood. Some human blood products have transmitted certain viruses to people who have received them. The risk of getting a virus from medicines made of human blood has been greatly reduced in recent years. This is the result of required testing of human donors for certain viruses, and testing during the manufacture of these medicines. Although the risk is low, talk with your doctor if you have concerns.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
