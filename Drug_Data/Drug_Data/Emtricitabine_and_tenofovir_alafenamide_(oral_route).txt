Description:
Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide combination is used together with other medicines to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This medicine is also used for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection. Your doctor may do tests to make sure you are negative from HIV-1 infection before taking this medicine for HIV-1 PrEP.

This medicine does not cure HIV infection or AIDS. It helps keep HIV from reproducing and appears to slow down the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay the development of problems that usually result from AIDS or HIV disease. It will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have other problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.
