Description:
Crizotinib is used to treat metastatic (cancer that has already spread) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is caused by a defect in either a gene called anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or a gene called ROS1. Your doctor will test for the presence of this gene.

Crizotinib is also used to treat relapsed (cancer that has come back) or refractory (cancer that did not respond to treatment) systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) with a defect in a gene called anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK).

Crizotinib is also used to treat unresectable (cancer that cannot be removed by surgery), recurrent (cancer that keeps coming back), or refractory (cancer that did not respond to treatment) inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) with a defect in a gene called anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK).

Crizotinib is an antineoplastic (cancer) agent. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
