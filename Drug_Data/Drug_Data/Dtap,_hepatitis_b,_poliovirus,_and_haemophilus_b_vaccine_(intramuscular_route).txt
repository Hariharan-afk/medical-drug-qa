Description:
DTaP, Hepatitis B, Poliovirus, and Haemophilus b combination vaccine is an active immunizing agent used to prevent infections caused by diphtheria, tetanus (lockjaw), pertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis B virus, poliovirus, and  Haemophilus influenza  type b (Hib) bacteria. The vaccine works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.

Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis, and Hib bacterial infection (eg, pneumonia, meningitis, epiglottitis, pericarditis, septic arthritis) are serious diseases that can cause life-threatening illnesses. Although some serious side effects can occur after a dose of Vaxelis™ (usually from the pertussis vaccine part), this rarely happens. The chance of your child catching one of these diseases, and being permanently injured or dying as a result, is much greater than the chance of your child getting a serious side effect from the vaccine.

This vaccine is recommended for children 6 weeks through 4 years of age (before the child's 5th birthday).

This vaccine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.
