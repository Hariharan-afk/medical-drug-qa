Description:
Docetaxel injection is used to treat advanced or metastatic (cancer that has spread) breast cancer in patients who have previously received other cancer medicines that did not work well. It is also used together with other medicines (eg, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin) to treat node-positive breast cancer that can be removed by surgery.

Docetaxel injection is also used to treat advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients who have previously received platinum-based cancer medicines that did not work well. It is also used together with cisplatin to treat advanced or metastatic NSCLC that cannot be removed by surgery in patients who have not received any cancer treatment for lung cancer.

Docetaxel injection is also used together with prednisone to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (prostate cancer that has spread and is resistant to medical or surgical treatments that lower testosterone).

Docetaxel injection is also used together with cisplatin and fluorouracil to treat advanced stomach cancer (eg, gastric adenocarcinoma, gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma) in patients who have not received cancer treatment for their advanced cancer.

Docetaxel injection is also used together with cisplatin and fluorouracil as first treatment for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).

Docetaxel belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics (cancer medicines). It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by docetaxel, other unwanted effects will also occur.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of docetaxel injection in children. However, because of docetaxel's alcohol content, it should be used with caution. Recommended doses should not be exceeded and the patient should be carefully monitored during treatment.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of docetaxel injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted effects and age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving docetaxel injection.
