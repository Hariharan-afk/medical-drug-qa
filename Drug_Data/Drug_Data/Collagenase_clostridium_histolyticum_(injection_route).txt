In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.


Other Interactions:
Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.  Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.  Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.

Proper Use:
A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a hospital. This medicine is given through a needle placed into the cord that is causing your finger to bend or into the plaque that is causing your penis to curve.

-> Your doctor may give you 2 injections if you have more than one contracture in the same hand.
-> It is very important that you return to your doctor 1 to 3 days after receiving the injection. This will allow your doctor to see the injected hand, and to do a possible finger extension procedure to disrupt the cord.
-> It is very important that you elevate the fingers of the injected hand until bedtime to prevent swelling. Do not try to move or massage the cord, bend, or extend the fingers of the injected hand, or do heavy activity using your hand to prevent more injury.

-> This medicine is given as part of a treatment cycle. In a treatment cycle, you will receive an injection followed by a second injection 1 to 3 days later.
-> It is very important that you return to your doctor 1 to 3 days after your second injection. This will allow your doctor to do a manual procedure to stretch and help straighten your penis.
-> Do not have sexual intercourse or have any sexual activity between the first and second injections of a treatment cycle, and for at least 4 weeks after the second injection of a treatment cycle and after pain and swelling has gone away.
