Description:
Gadoversetamide injection is used to help diagnose or find problems in the brain, spine, head, neck, liver, and other parts of your body. It is a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Contrast agents are used to help create a clear picture of the different parts of the body during certain medical procedures, such as MRI scans. MRI scans use magnets and computers to create images or “pictures” of certain areas inside the body. Unlike x-rays, they do not involve ionizing radiation.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.


Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of gadoversetamide injection in the pediatric population. However, pediatric patients with serious kidney problems may require caution in patients receiving this medicine. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of gadoversetamide injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution in patients receiving gadoversetamide.


Breastfeeding:
There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.
