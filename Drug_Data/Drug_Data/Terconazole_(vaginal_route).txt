To use the vaginal cream :

-> The vaginal cream comes in a tube. You will use an applicator to put the cream into your vagina.

Hold the applicator by the open end of the barrel and gently insert it into the vagina as far as it will comfortably go. Slowly press the plunger of the applicator to release the cream into the vagina, and then gently remove it.
-> After using, pull the plunger completely out of the applicator and wash both pieces with lukewarm, soapy water, and dry thoroughly.
