Description:
Minocycline is used to help treat periodontal disease (a disease of your gums). Periodontal disease is caused by bacteria growing beneath the gum line. Minocycline works by keeping the number of bacteria from growing. Lowering the amount of bacteria helps to reduce inflammation and swelling in your mouth, and the amount of bleeding around the teeth. Minocycline is placed in deep gum pockets next to your teeth in order to reduce the depth of the pockets.

This medicine will be applied by your dentist or other oral health care professional.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines.

For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Use is not recommended in infants and children up to 8 years of age. Tetracyclines, such as minocycline, may cause permanent discoloration of teeth and slow down the growth of bones. The safety and effectiveness of minocycline have not been determined in children 8 years of age or older.


Geriatric:
Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of minocycline in the elderly with use in other age groups.

-> Do not chew hard, crunchy, or sticky foods for 1 week after treatment.
-> Do not brush near any treated areas. Wait 12 hours after the procedure before brushing the other teeth.

Precautions:
Check with your dentist as soon as possible if you have pain or swelling or other problems in the treated areas.

It is very important that your dentist check your progress. Do not miss any dental appointments.

Tetracyclines, such as minocycline, may cause your skin to be more sensitive to sunlight than normal. Exposure to sunlight, even for brief periods of time, may cause a skin rash, itching, redness or other discoloration of the skin, or a severe sunburn. After receiving minocycline:

-> Stay out of direct sunlight, especially between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., if possible.
-> Wear protective clothing, including a hat. Also, wear sunglasses.
