Description:
Methotrexate  tablet  is used alone or together with other medicines to treat several types of cancer, such as breast, head and neck, lung, blood (eg, acute lymphoblastic leukemia or ALL), bone, lymph node (eg, mycosis fungoides, relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma), or uterus cancer. It is also used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, severe psoriasis (a skin disease), lupus, multiple sclerosis, and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA).

Methotrexate  oral solution  is used together with other medicines to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or did not respond to previous treatment (refractory). It is also used alone or together with other medicines to treat mycosis fungoides. This medicine is also used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, severe psoriasis (a skin disease), and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA).

Methotrexate belongs to the group of medicines known as antineoplastics (cancer medicines). It blocks an enzyme that is needed by cells to live. This interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

Methotrexate can lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, which increases the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

-> If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
-> Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.

-> Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.

-> Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.

While you are being treated with methotrexate, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Methotrexate may lower your body's resistance and the vaccine may not work as well or you might get the infection the vaccine is meant to prevent. In addition, you should not be around other persons living in your household who receive live virus vaccines because there is a chance they could pass the virus on to you. Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.
