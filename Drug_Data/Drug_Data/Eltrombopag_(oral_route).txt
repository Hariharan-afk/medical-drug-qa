Description:
Eltrombopag is used to treat thrombocytopenia (low platelets in the blood) in patients with a blood disorder called chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). This medicine is used after a splenectomy (surgery to remove the spleen) and other medicines (eg, steroids or immunoglobulin) have not worked well enough. Eltrombopag is also used to treat thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic hepatitis C, along with interferon treatment. Platelets help clot the blood, so a person with thrombocytopenia may have bleeding problems. Eltrombopag works by stimulating the bone marrow to produce more platelets.

Eltrombopag is used together with standard immunosuppressive treatment for the first-line treatment of severe aplastic anemia (SAA) in adults and children 2 years of age and older. It is also used to treat SAA in patients who have received other medicines that did not work well.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet
-> Powder for Suspension

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Alvaiz™:  Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of eltrombopag for the  treatment of ITP  in children younger than 6 years of age and for the  treatment of chronic hepatitis C and severe aplastic anemia  in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

Promacta®:  Safety and efficacy have not been established to treat ITP in children younger than 1 year of age, or in children with thrombocytopenia associated with chronic hepatitis C or severe aplastic anemia.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of eltrombopag in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving eltrombopag.
