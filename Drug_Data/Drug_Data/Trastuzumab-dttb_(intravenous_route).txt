Description:
Trastuzumab-dttb injection is used to treat HER2-overexpressing node positive or node negative (ER/PR negative or with one high risk feature) breast cancer. It can be used alone after a previous treatment with an anthracycline medicine or with other cancer medicines (eg, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, doxorubicin, paclitaxel).

Trastuzumab-dttb injection is also used alone to treat HER2-overexpressing metastatic (cancer that has spread) breast cancer in patients who have previously received one or more cancer treatments or as first-line treatment together with paclitaxel to treat HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.

Trastuzumab-dttb injection is also used in combination with cisplatin and capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil to treat HER2-overexpressing metastatic (cancer that has spread) stomach and gastroesophageal (stomach and esophagus) cancer.

Trastuzumab-dttb prevents the growth of some tumors that produce extra amounts of a certain substance known as the HER2 protein.  It should only be used in patients whose tumors have been shown to produce extra amounts of this protein (HER2 overexpression) . Your doctor will test for the presence of this protein.

Trastuzumab-dttb is a monoclonal antibody. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by trastuzumab-dttb, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
