Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant during treatment and for 2 months after the last dose of this medicine. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.

Dinutuximab can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

-> If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you or your child think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
-> Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
-> Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
-> Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
-> Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
-> Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.
Tell your doctor right away if you or your child have black, tarry stools, blood in the urine, fever, increased or decreased urination, pinpoint red spots on the skin, stomach pain, swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs, unusual bleeding, bruising, or weakness, or yellow eyes or skin after receiving this medicine.
