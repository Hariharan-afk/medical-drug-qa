Description:
Rituximab injection is used alone or together with other medicines to treat a type of cancer called non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). It is also used in combination with other cancer medicines to treat mature B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and mature B-cell acute leukemia (B-AL). It helps the immune system destroy cancer cells. Rituximab injection is a monoclonal antibody.

Rituximab injection is used together with other medicines (eg, fludarabine cyclophosphamide) to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

Rituximab injection is used together with methotrexate to treat the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. It helps to keep joint damage from getting worse after other medicines (eg, adalimumab, etanercept, or infliximab) did not work well.

Rituximab injection is used together with steroids to treat granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). These are immune disorders that cause blood vessels to be inflamed.

Rituximab injection is also used to treat moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris (PV), an immune disorder that causes painful blisters on the skin and mucous membranes.

For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of rituximab injection in children. However, use of rituximab injection is not indicated in children younger than 2 years of age with GPA or MPA, in children younger than 6 months of age with mature B-cell NHL and B-AL, or in children with other conditions.


Geriatric:

If you think you have become pregnant while receiving this medicine, tell your doctor right away.

Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should wear a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.
