Description:
Omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate combination is used to treat certain conditions where there is too much acid in the stomach. It is used to treat gastric and duodenal ulcers, erosive esophagitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is a condition where the acid in the stomach washes back up into the esophagus. Sometimes this medicine is used in combination with antibiotics (eg, amoxicillin, clarithromycin) to treat ulcers associated with infection caused by the H. pylori bacteria (germ).

Omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate combination is used to prevent upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding in seriously ill patients.

Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It works by decreasing the amount of acid produced by the stomach.

Sodium bicarbonate, also known as baking soda, is an antacid. It works by neutralizing the excess acid in the stomach.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Capsule
-> Packet
-> Powder for Suspension
