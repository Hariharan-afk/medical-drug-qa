Description:
Ferric carboxymaltose injection is an iron replacement product that is used to treat iron deficiency anemia (not enough iron in the blood) in patients with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD), in patients who cannot take iron supplements or who are taking iron supplements that did not work well, and in patients with heart failure to improve the ability to exercise.

Iron is a mineral that the body needs to produce red blood cells. When the body does not get enough iron, it cannot produce the number of normal red blood cells needed to keep you in good health. This condition is called iron deficiency (iron shortage) or iron deficiency anemia.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.
