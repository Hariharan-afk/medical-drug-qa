Description:
Alogliptin and pioglitazone combination is used with proper diet and exercise to treat high blood sugar levels caused by type 2 diabetes. Alogliptin helps to control blood sugar levels by increasing substances in the body that make the pancreas release more insulin. It also signals the liver to stop producing sugar (glucose) when there is too much of it in the blood. Pioglitazone works by helping your body use insulin better. This medicine does not help patients who have insulin-dependent or type 1 diabetes.
