Description:
Valganciclovir is used to treat symptoms of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, an infection in the eyes of people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Valganciclovir will not cure this eye infection, but it may help to keep the symptoms from becoming worse.

Valganciclovir is an antiviral. It is used to treat infections caused by viruses. This medicine is also used to prevent CMV disease in patients who have received an organ transplant (eg, heart, kidney, or kidney-pancreas transplant).

This medicine may cause some serious side effects, including anemia and other blood problems. Before you begin treatment with valganciclovir, you and your doctor should talk about the benefit this medicine will do as well as the risks of using it.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet
-> Powder for Solution

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of valganciclovir for the prevention of CMV disease in kidney and heart transplant children. However, safety and efficacy of valganciclovir for the prevention of CMV disease have not been established in liver transplant children, in kidney transplant children younger than 4 months of age, and in heart transplant children younger than 1 month of age.


Geriatric:
Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of valganciclovir have not been performed in the geriatric population, no geriatric-specific problems have been documented to date. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving valganciclovir.


Breastfeeding:
There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.

Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.

The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

Proper Use:
Take this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor . Do not change the dose or stop using this medicine without checking first with your doctor. When your supply of this medicine is running low, contact your doctor or pharmacist ahead of time. Do not allow yourself to run out of this medicine.

It is important that you take this medicine with food. This is to make sure the medicine is fully absorbed into the body and will work properly.

Swallow the  tablet  whole. Do not break, crush, or chew it.

Be careful not to handle crushed or broken tablets. If you have contact with broken or crushed tablets or mixed oral liquid, wash your skin with soap and clear water. If the medicine gets into your eyes, rinse them with clear water.

If you are using the  oral liquid , use the oral dispenser that comes with the package to measure each dose accurately. The average household teaspoon may not hold the right amount of liquid.

If you are taking ganciclovir (Cytovene®) capsules before switching to valganciclovir (Valcyte®) tablets, the dose of your medicine may change. Although these medicines both treat the same problem, they are absorbed differently by your body. Make sure you understand the new directions for Valcyte® so you do not take too many tablets.

To get the best results, valganciclovir must be given for the full time of treatment. Also, this medicine works best when there is a constant amount in the blood. To help keep the amount constant, valganciclovir must be taken on a regular schedule.
