Description:
Aspirin, sodium bicarbonate, and citric acid combination is used to relieve pain occurring together with heartburn, sour stomach, or acid indigestion.

The aspirin in this combination is the pain reliever. Aspirin belongs to the group of medicines known as salicylates and to the group of medicines known as anti-inflammatory analgesics. The sodium bicarbonate in this medicine is an antacid. It neutralizes stomach acid by combining with it to form a new substance that is not an acid.

Aspirin, sodium bicarbonate, and citric acid combination may also be used to lessen the chance of heart attack, stroke, or other problems that may occur when a blood vessel is blocked by blood clots. The aspirin in this medicine helps prevent dangerous blood clots from forming. However, this effect of aspirin may increase the chance of serious bleeding in some people. Therefore, aspirin should be used for this purpose only when your doctor decides, after studying your medical condition and history, that the danger of blood clots is greater than the risk of bleeding. Do not take aspirin to prevent blood clots or a heart attack unless it has been ordered by your doctor.

This combination medicine is available without a prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet, Effervescent
-> Tablet

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Do not give any medicine containing aspirin to a child with fever or other symptoms of a virus infection, especially flu or chickenpox, without first discussing its use with your child's doctor . This is very important because aspirin may cause a serious illness called Reye's syndrome in children with fever caused by a virus infection, especially flu or chickenpox. Children who do not have a virus infection may also be more sensitive to the effects of aspirin, especially if they have a fever or have lost large amounts of body fluid because of vomiting, diarrhea, or sweating. This may increase the chance of side effects during treatment.


Geriatric:
People 60 years of age and older are especially sensitive to the effects of aspirin. This may increase the chance of side effects during treatment. Also, the sodium in this combination medicine can be harmful to some elderly people, especially if large amounts of the medicine are taken regularly. Therefore, it is best that older people not use this medicine for more than 5 days in a row, unless otherwise directed by their doctor.

The sodium bicarbonate in this combination medicine can keep other medicines from working properly if the 2 medicines are taken too close together. Always take this medicine:

-> At least 6 hours before or 2 hours after taking ciprofloxacin (e.g., Cipro) or lomefloxacin (e.g., Maxaquin).
-> At least 8 hours before or 2 hours after taking enoxacin (e.g., Penetrex).
-> At least 2 hours after taking itraconazole (e.g., Sporanox).
-> At least 3 hours before or after taking ketoconazole (e.g., Nizoral).
-> At least 2 hours before or after taking norfloxacin (e.g., Noroxin) or ofloxacin (e.g., Floxin).
-> At least 3 or 4 hours before or after taking a tetracycline antibiotic by mouth.
-> At least 1 or 2 hours before or after taking any other medicine by mouth.
If you are also taking a laxative that contains cellulose, take this combination medicine at least 2 hours before or after you take the laxative. Taking the medicines too close together may lessen the effects of aspirin.

Check the labels of all nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) and prescription medicines you now take. If any contain aspirin or other salicylates, including bismuth subsalicylate (e.g., Pepto-Bismol), magnesium salicylate (e.g., Nuprin Backache Caplets), or salsalate (e.g., Disalcid); if any contain salicylic acid (present in some shampoos or medicines for your skin); or if any contain sodium, check with your health care professional. Taking other salicylate-containing or other sodium-containing products together with this medicine may cause an overdose.

Do not take aspirin for 5 days before any surgery, including dental surgery, unless otherwise directed by your medical doctor or dentist. Taking aspirin during this time may cause bleeding problems.

For patients taking this medicine to lessen the chance of a heart attack, stroke, or other problems caused by blood clots:

-> Take only the amount of aspirin ordered by your doctor. If you need a medicine to relieve pain, a fever, or arthritis, your doctor may not want you to take extra aspirin. It is a good idea to discuss this with your doctor, so that you will know ahead of time what medicine to take.
-> Do not stop taking this medicine for any reason without first checking with the doctor who directed you to take it.
Taking certain other medicines together with a salicylate may increase the chance of unwanted effects. The risk will depend on how much of each medicine you take every day, and on how long you take the medicines together. If your doctor directs you to take these medicines together on a regular basis, follow his or her directions carefully. However, do not take any of the following medicines together with a salicylate for more than a few days, unless your doctor has directed you to do so and is following your progress:

-> Acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol)
-> Diclofenac (e.g., Voltaren)
-> Diflunisal (e.g., Dolobid)
-> Etodolac (e.g., Lodine)
-> Fenoprofen (e.g., Nalfon)
-> Floctafenine (e.g., Idarac)
-> Flurbiprofen, oral (e.g., Ansaid)
-> Ibuprofen (e.g., Motrin)
-> Indomethacin (e.g., Indocin)
-> Ketoprofen (e.g., Orudis)
-> Ketorolac (e.g., Toradol)
-> Meclofenamate (e.g., Meclomen)
-> Mefenamic acid (e.g., Ponstel)
-> Nabumetone (e.g., Relafen)
-> Naproxen (e.g., Naprosyn)
-> Oxaprozin (e.g., Daypro)
-> Phenylbutazone (e.g., Butazolidin)
-> Piroxicam (e.g., Feldene)
-> Sulindac (e.g., Clinoril)
-> Tenoxicam (e.g., Mobiflex)
-> Tiaprofenic acid (e.g., Surgam)
-> Tolmetin (e.g., Tolectin)
If you will be taking more than an occasional 1 or 2 doses of this medicine:

-> Do not drink alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcoholic beverages while you are taking aspirin, especially if you take aspirin regularly or in large amounts, may increase the chance of stomach problems.
-> Do not drink a lot of milk or eat a lot of milk products. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.
-> To prevent side effects caused by too much sodium in the body, you may need to limit the amount of sodium in the foods you eat. Some foods that contain large amounts of sodium are canned soup, canned vegetables, pickles, ketchup, green and ripe (black) olives, relish, frankfurters and other sausage-type meats, soy sauce, and carbonated beverages. If you have any questions about this, check with your health care professional.
Before you have any medical tests, tell the person in charge that you are taking this medicine. The results of some tests may be affected by the aspirin in this combination medicine.

For diabetic patients:

-> Aspirin can cause false urine glucose (sugar) test results if you regularly take 8 or more 324-mg, or 4 or more 500-mg (extra-strength), tablets a day. Smaller amounts or occasional use of aspirin usually will not affect the test results. However, check with your health care professional if you notice any change in your urine glucose test results. This is especially important if your diabetes is not well-controlled.
If you think that you or anyone else may have taken an overdose, get emergency help at once. Taking an overdose of aspirin may cause unconsciousness or death, especially in young children. Signs of overdose include convulsions (seizures), hearing loss, confusion, ringing or buzzing in the ears, severe drowsiness or tiredness, severe excitement or nervousness, and fast or deep breathing.

Although the following side effects occur very rarely when 1 or 2 doses of this combination medicine is taken occasionally, they may be more likely to occur if: too much medicine is taken, the medicine is taken several times a day, or the medicine is taken for more than a few days in a row.
