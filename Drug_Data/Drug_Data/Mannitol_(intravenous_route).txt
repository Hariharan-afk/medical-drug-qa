Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Pediatric:

However, children younger than 2 years of age, especially preterm and term neonates, are more likely to have fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Safety and efficacy have been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of prochlorperazine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have fluid and electrolyte imbalances and age-related kidney, heart, or lung problems, which may require caution in the dose for patients receiving this medicine.
