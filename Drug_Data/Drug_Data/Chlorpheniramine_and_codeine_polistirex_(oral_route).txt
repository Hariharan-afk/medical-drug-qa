Description:
Codeine polistirex and chlorpheniramine polistirex combination is used to treat cough and respiratory symptoms associated with a cold or allergy.

Codeine polistirex is a narcotic cough suppressant. It acts directly on the cough center in the brain to prevent a cough. Chlorpheniramine polistirex is an antihistamine that treats or prevents the symptoms of an allergy.

When codeine polistirex is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming. This could cause mental or physical dependence. Physical dependence may lead to unwanted withdrawal effects if codeine is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely. Talk to your doctor if you have questions.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
