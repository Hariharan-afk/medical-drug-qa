Description:
Antihemophilic factor (AHF) injection is used to treat, control, prevent, and decrease the frequency of bleeding episodes, and prevent bleeding during surgery in patients with hemophilia A (congenital Factor VIII deficiency).

Antihemophilic factor (AHF) is a protein that is produced naturally in the body. It helps the blood form clots to stop bleeding and prevents bleeding problems from happening as often.

Hemophilia A, also called classical hemophilia, is a condition where the body does not make enough AHF. If you do not have enough AHF and you become injured, your blood will not form clots properly. You might bleed into and damage your muscles and joints. AHF injection is given to increase the levels of AHF in the blood.

There are several different types of AHF. They are made from human blood or artificially by a man-made process (recombinant). AHF made from human blood has been treated and is not likely to contain harmful viruses, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The man-made AHF products do not contain these viruses.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

To prepare the medicine using 2 bottles (vials) or containers :

-> Take the bottles of powder medicine and liquid (diluent) out of the refrigerator and let them warm to room temperature.
-> Wipe the rubber surface of the bottles with an alcohol swab and allow them to dry.
-> Follow the specific directions for your brand of medicine when you prepare the injection.
-> Add the liquid to the powder using the special transfer needle or transfer device that comes with the package.
-> When injecting the liquid into the dry medicine, aim the stream of liquid against the wall of the container of dry medicine to prevent foaming.
-> Swirl the bottle gently to dissolve the medicine. Do not shake the bottle. Shaking will create foam in the mixture.
-> Check the mixture to make sure it is clear. Do not use the medicine if you can see anything solid in the mixture or if the mixture is cloudy.
-> Use a plastic disposable syringe to remove the mixture from the bottle. Use a special filter needle if your brand of medicine provides one.
-> Give the injection as directed by your doctor.
-> If you are using more than one bottle of medicine for your dose, prepare the second bottle the same way. Add the mixture from the second bottle to the same syringe.
To prepare the medicine using a prefilled dual-chamber syringe (Xyntha® and Xyntha® Solofuse®) :

-> Take the prefilled dual-chamber syringe out of the refrigerator and warm it to room temperature.
-> The dual-chamber syringe has the powder medicine in one part and the liquid (diluent) in the second part of the syringe.
-> Attach the plunger rod to the syringe according to the directions. Keep the syringe pointed up to prevent leaking of the liquid.
-> Remove the white seal and the grey rubber tip cap. Put the blue vented cap on the syringe. Do not touch the open ends of the syringe and the blue cap.
-> Slowly push the plunger until the 2 stoppers inside the syringe are together. This will push all of the liquid into the chamber with the powder medicine.
-> Keep the syringe pointed up and gently swirl the syringe to mix the liquid and powder.
-> Check the mixture to make sure it is clear. Do not use the medicine if you can see anything solid in the mixture or if the mixture is cloudy.
-> Keep the syringe pointed up and push the plunger until most of the air is removed.
-> A special infusion set comes with the package. Remove the blue cap and attach the infusion set to the syringe.
-> Give the injection as directed by your doctor.
-> If you are using more than one syringe of medicine for your dose, prepare the second dual-chamber syringe the same way. The mixture from each syringe will be combined together in a separate syringe before your injection. Your doctor will show you how to do this.
Use the mixture within 3 or 4 hours after it is prepared . It must not be stored and used later. Do not put the mixture in the refrigerator.
