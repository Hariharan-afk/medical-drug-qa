USBrand Name:
Probuphine


Description:
Buprenorphine implant is used for the maintenance treatment of opioid (narcotic) dependence in patients who have received other medicines containing buprenorphine (eg, Suboxone®, Subutex®).

When a narcotic medicine is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if the narcotic is stopped suddenly. Severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented when a person is switched to buprenorphine. It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to help prevent the withdrawal side effects.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a trained healthcare professional.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

The top adhesive bandage will be placed over the arm and should be left on for 24 hours. Keep the smaller, bottom bandage clean and dry and in place for 3 to 5 days.

You should apply an ice pack to your arm for 40 minutes every 2 hours for the first 24 hours after placing the implants or as needed.
