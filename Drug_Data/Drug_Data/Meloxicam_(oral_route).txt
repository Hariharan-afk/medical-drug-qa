Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of meloxicam  oral liquid  or  tablets  to treat juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in children 2 years of age and older or meloxicam  disintegrating tablets  in children 2 years of age and older weighing 60 kilograms (kg) or more.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of meloxicam  capsules  in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of meloxicam in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have serious stomach, heart, or kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving this medicine.
