Description:
Saquinavir is used together with ritonavir (Norvir®) and other antiviral medicines for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Saquinavir will not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS. It helps keep HIV from reproducing and slows the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay problems related to AIDS or HIV disease from occurring. Saquinavir will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people.

This medicine (tablet) is available only with your doctor's prescription.  The capsules are not currently being marketed .


Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of saquinavir in children 16 years of age and younger. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of saquinavir in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution in patients receiving saquinavir.
