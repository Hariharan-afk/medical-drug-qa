Check with your doctor if you have symptoms of an infection such as a fever, chills, body aches, or sore throat. This medicine may decrease the amount of white blood cells in the blood.

Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.
