Description:
Oxycodone is used to relieve pain severe enough to require opioid treatment and when other pain medicines did not work well enough or cannot be tolerated. It belongs to the group of medicines called opioid analgesics (pain medicines). Oxycodone acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain.

Oxycodone  extended-release capsules or tablets  should not be used if you need pain medicine for just a short time, such as when recovering from surgery. Do not use this medicine to relieve mild pain, or in situations when non-opioid medication is effective. This medicine should not be used to treat pain that you only have once in a while or "as needed".

When oxycodone is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, under the close supervision of healthcare providers, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using opioids to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is less likely to occur when opioids are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal symptoms if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal symptoms can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.

This medicine is available only under a restricted distribution program called the Opioid Analgesic REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Capsule, Extended Release
-> Tablet, Extended Release
-> Tablet
-> Solution
-> Capsule

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of  Oxaydo® ,  Roxicodone® ,  Roxybond™ , and  Xtampza® ER  in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of  Oxycontin®  in children. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 11 years of age.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of oxycodone in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, heart, or lung problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving oxycodone in order to avoid potentially serious side effects.

Proper Use:
Take this medicine only as directed by your doctor . Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. This is especially important for elderly patients, who may be more sensitive to the effects of pain medicines. If too much of this medicine is taken for a long time, it may become habit-forming (causing mental or physical dependence).

It is very important that you understand the rules of the Opioid Analgesic REMS program to prevent addiction, abuse, and misuse of oxycodone. This medicine should also come with a Medication Guide and a patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Read it again each time you refill your prescription in case there is new information. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

Close follow-up with healthcare providers and creation of a pain management plan is an effective way to manage chronic pain. This plan may include limiting opioid medicines to the lowest effective dose for a limited period of time. The plan may also include non-medicine treatments such as relaxation techniques, massage therapy, or transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS).

Oxycodone  extended-release capsules or tablets  should only be used by patients who have already been taking opioid pain medicines. These patients are called  opioid-tolerant . If you are uncertain whether or not you are opioid-tolerant, check with your doctor before using this medicine.

Measure the  oral liquid concentrate  with the calibrated dropper that comes with the package. Your doctor may have you mix the concentrate with a small amount of liquid or food. Carefully follow the instructions and take the medicine mixture right away.

Measure the  oral liquid  with a marked measuring spoon, oral syringe, or medicine cup. The average household teaspoon may not hold the right amount of liquid.

Swallow the  Oxaydo®  or  OxyContin® tablet  whole with water. Do not break, crush, cut, chew, or dissolve it. Do not pre-soak, lick, or wet the tablet before placing it in the mouth. Take one tablet at a time. Also, do not give this medicine through nasogastric or feeding tubes.

If you are using the extended-release capsules:

-> Take this medicine with food and with about the same amount of food each time.
-> If you have trouble swallowing, you may open the capsule and sprinkle the contents on soft foods (eg, applesauce, pudding, yogurt, ice cream, or jam) or into a cup and swallow immediately. Drink a glass of water to make sure all the medicine has been taken.
-> This medicine may also be given through a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube.
Oxycodone  extended-release capsules or tablets  work differently from the regular oxycodone oral solution or tablets, even at the same dose. Do not switch from one brand or form to the other unless your doctor tells you to.

While taking the  Roxybond™ tablet , part of it may pass into your stool. This is normal and nothing to worry about.


Dosing:
The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.

The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.

Here is the link to the FDA safe disposal of medicines website: www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/ensuringsafeuseofmedicine/safedisposalofmedicines/ucm186187.htm


Precautions:
It is very important that your doctor check your progress while you are using this medicine , especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of treatment. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to take it. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Do not use this medicine if you are using or have used an MAO inhibitor (MAOI) (eg, isocarboxazid [Marplan®], linezolid [Zyvox®], phenelzine [Nardil®], selegiline [Eldepryl®], tranylcypromine [Parnate®]) within the past 14 days.

This medicine may cause a serious type of allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing or swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using this medicine.

It is against the law and dangerous for anyone else to use your medicine. Keep your unused medicine in a safe and secure place. People who are addicted to drugs might want to steal this medicine.

If you think you or someone else may have taken an overdose of this medicine, get emergency help at once.  Your doctor may also give naloxone to treat an overdose. Naloxone is a medicine that temporarily reverses the effects of an overdose. If you have been prescribed naloxone, make sure household members know how to use this on you in the event of an overdose or suspected overdose. Emergency medical attention is still needed after naloxone is used because the reversal effects are only temporary. Signs of an overdose include : change or loss of consciousness, cold, clammy skin, coughing that sometimes produces a pink frothy sputum, decreased awareness or responsiveness, extreme dizziness or weakness, increased sweating, irregular, fast, or slow, or shallow breathing, pale or blue lips, fingernails, or skin, sleepiness or unusual drowsiness, slow heartbeat, seizures, swelling in legs and ankles, or trouble breathing. Call your doctor right away if you notice these symptoms.

This medicine may cause sleep-related breathing problems (eg, sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoxemia). Your doctor may decrease your dose if you have sleep apnea (stop breathing for short periods during sleep) while using this medicine.

This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants. Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, other prescription pain medicine or opioids, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics (numbing medicines), including some dental anesthetics. This effect may last for a few days after you stop using this medicine. Check with your doctor before taking any of these medicines while you are using this medicine .

This medicine may be habit-forming. If you feel that the medicine is not working as well, do not use more than your prescribed dose. Call your doctor for instructions.

Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help lessen this problem. Also, lying down for a while may relieve dizziness or lightheadedness.

This medicine may make you dizzy, drowsy, or lightheaded. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you .

Using opioids for a long time can cause severe constipation. To prevent this, your doctor may direct you to take laxatives, drink a lot of fluids, or increase the amount of fiber in your diet. Be sure to follow the directions carefully, because continuing constipation can lead to more serious problems.

If you have been using this medicine regularly for several weeks or longer, do not change your dose or suddenly stop using it without checking with your doctor . Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely. This may help prevent worsening of your condition and reduce the possibility of withdrawal symptoms, such as stomach cramps, anxiety, fever, nausea, restlessness, runny nose, sweating, tremors, or trouble sleeping.

Using this medicine while you are pregnant may cause serious unwanted effects, including neonatal withdrawal syndrome in your newborn baby. Tell your doctor right away if you think you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant while using this medicine.

For nursing mothers :

-> Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about taking oxycodone or about how this medicine may affect your baby. This medicine may be present in your breast milk and passed to your baby.

-> Your baby should generally nurse every 2 to 3 hours and should not sleep for more than 4 hours at a time.
-> Check with your doctor or hospital emergency room immediately if your baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, difficulty breathing, or limpness. These may be symptoms of an overdose and need immediate medical attention.
Using too much of this medicine may cause infertility (unable to have children). Talk with your doctor before using this medicine if you plan to have children.

Call your doctor right away if you have worsening of pain, increased sensitivity to pain, or new pain after taking this medicine. These may be symptoms of opioid-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia.

This medicine may cause adrenal gland problems. Check with your doctor right away if you have darkening of the skin, diarrhea, dizziness, fainting, loss of appetite, mental depression, nausea, skin rash, unusual tiredness or weakness, or vomiting.

Check with your doctor right away if you have anxiety, restlessness, a fast heartbeat, fever, sweating, muscle spasms, twitching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or see or hear things that are not there. These may be symptoms of a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. Your risk may be higher if you also take certain other medicines that affect serotonin levels in your body.

Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using this medicine. This medicine may affect the results of certain medical tests.
