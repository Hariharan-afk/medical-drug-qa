Description:
Amlodipine and celecoxib combination is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and help relieve the symptoms of osteoarthritis (eg, swelling, stiffness, and joint pain).

Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker (CCB). It affects the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. This relaxes the blood vessels and lowers blood pressure, which will increase the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.

Celecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It does not cure osteoarthritis and will help you only as long as you continue to use it.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet
