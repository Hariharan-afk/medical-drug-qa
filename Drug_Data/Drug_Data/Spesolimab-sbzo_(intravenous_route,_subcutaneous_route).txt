Make sure you understand all instructions before you give yourself an injection. Do not use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor tells you to.

This medicine comes with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have questions.

Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. Do not inject into skin areas that are red, bruised, tender, damaged, hard, or areas with scars. Do not inject an area near your waistline or belly button.

Allow the  prefilled syringe  to warm to room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes before using it. Do not warm it in any other way (eg, microwave, hot water, or direct sunlight).

To use the  prefilled syringe :

-> Wash your hands with soap and water before and after using this medicine.
-> Do not remove the needle cap.
-> Check the liquid in the syringe. It should be clear and colorless to slightly brownish-yellow. Do not use it if it is cloudy, discolored, or has flakes or large or colored particles in it. Do not use the syringe if it is damaged, dropped, broken, leaking, or has cracks.
-> Hold the syringe by the finger grip with one hand. Using your other hand, pull the cap straight off. Do not pull on or hold the plunger rod. Do not twist the cap. Do not put the cap back on.
-> Gently pinch the skin. Hold the syringe by the blue finger grip. Using a quick, "dart-like" motion, insert the needle into the pinched skin at a 45 degree angle. Do not move the needle.
-> Use your thumb to slowly press down on the blue thumb pad to push the plunger rod inside the syringe body. Continue pressing the blue thumb pad until the plunger rod has moved all the way down.
