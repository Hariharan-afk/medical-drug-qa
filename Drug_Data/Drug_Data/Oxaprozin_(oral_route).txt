Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of oxaprozin tablets in children younger than 16 years of age. Safety and efficacy of oxaprozin in children has not been established.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects  Coxanto®  and  Daypro®  to  treat juvenile rheumatoid arthritis  in children younger than 6 years of age and to  treat osteoarthritis  in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
