Description:
Adalimumab-afzb injection is used to treat the symptoms and prevent the progression of moderate to severely active rheumatoid arthritis and active ankylosing spondylitis. It is used in children 2 years of age and older for juvenile idiopathic arthritis. This medicine is also used to treat psoriatic arthritis, which is a type of arthritis that causes pain and swelling in the joints along with patches of scaly skin on some areas of the body. Psoriatic arthritis usually occurs with a skin condition called psoriasis. Adalimumab-afzb may be used alone or in combination with other medicines (eg, methotrexate).

Adalimumab-afzb injection is also used to treat moderate to severe active Crohn's disease. It is also used to treat moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in patients who have been treated with other medicines (eg, azathioprine, corticosteroids, or 6-mercaptopurine) that did not work well.

Adalimumab-afzb injection is also used to treat moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis, which is a skin disease with red patches and white scales that do not go away. It is given to patients who may receive other types of treatment, including pills, injection, or phototherapy (light treatment). It is also used to treat moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa, a chronic skin disease that causes small, painful lumps under the skin.

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of adalimumab-afzb injection for the  treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis  in children 2 years of age and older and for the treatment of Crohn's disease  in children 6 years of age and older. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 2 years of age or weighing less than 10 kilograms (kg) for juvenile idiopathic arthritis, in children younger than 6 years of age for Crohn's disease, and in children for other conditions.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of adalimumab-afzb injection in the elderly. However, this medicine may cause serious infections and cancer more often in the elderly, which may require caution in patients receiving this medicine.

Adalimumab-afzb injection will lower the number of some types of blood cells in your body. Because of this, you may bleed or get infections more easily. To help with these problems, avoid being near people who are sick or have infections. Wash your hands often. Stay away from rough sports or other situations where you could be bruised, cut, or injured. Brush and floss your teeth gently. Be careful when using sharp objects, including razors and fingernail clippers.

This medicine may cause other unwanted effects that may not occur until months or years after this medicine is used. A small number of people (including children and teenagers) who have used this type of medicine have developed certain types of cancer (eg, leukemia). Some patients also developed a rare type of cancer called lymphoma. Talk with your doctor if you or your child have unusual bleeding, bruising, or weakness, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarms, or groin, or unexplained weight loss. Also, check with your doctor right away if your skin has red, scaly patches, or raised bumps that are filled with pus.

Adalimumab-afzb injection may cause serious allergic reactions (eg, anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema), which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have cough, difficulty swallowing, dizziness, fast heartbeat, large, hive-like swelling on the face, eyelids, lips, tongue, throat, hands, legs, feet, or sex organs, rash, itching, trouble breathing, or unusual tiredness or weakness after using this medicine.

Check with your doctor right away if you or your child has swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs, sudden weight gain, or trouble breathing. These may be signs of a heart condition called congestive heart failure (CHF).

Some people who have used this medicine developed lupus-like symptoms during treatment and got better after the medicine was stopped. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child start having chest pains, joint pain, or a rash on your cheeks or arms that is sensitive to the sun.

Do not have any live vaccines (immunizations) while you or your child are being treated with adalimumab-afzb. Your child's vaccines need to be current before he or she begins using this medicine. Be sure to ask your child's doctor if you have any questions about this.
