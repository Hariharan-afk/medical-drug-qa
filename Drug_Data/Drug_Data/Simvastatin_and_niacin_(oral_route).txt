Description:
Simvastatin and niacin combination is used together with a proper diet to lower cholesterol and triglyceride (fat) levels in the blood. This medicine may help prevent medical problems caused by clogged blood vessels, such as heart attacks and strokes.

Simvastatin and niacin work together to treat cholesterol and lipid (fat) disorders. Niacin is vitamin B3, which reduces the amount of cholesterol in the blood. Simvastatin belongs to the group of medicines called HMG-CoA inhibitors or statins. It works to reduce the amount of cholesterol in the blood by blocking an enzyme that is needed to make cholesterol.

This medicine was available only with your doctor's prescription. The Simcor(R) product will no longer be marketed in the United States as of April 18, 2016.
