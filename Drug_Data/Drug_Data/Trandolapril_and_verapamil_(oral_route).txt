Description:
Trandolapril and verapamil combination is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.

Trandolapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes blood vessels to tighten. As a result, trandolapril relaxes the blood vessels. This lowers blood pressure and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.

Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker (CCB). It affects the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. This relaxes the blood vessels, lowers blood pressure, and increase the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
