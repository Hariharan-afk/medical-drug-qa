Description:
Mangafodipir is an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) contrast agent (also known as paramagnetic agents). MRI agents are used to help provide a clear picture during MRI. MRI is a special kind of diagnostic procedure. It uses magnets and computers to create images or “pictures” of certain areas inside the body. Unlike x-rays, it does not involve ionizing radiation.

Mangafodipir is given by injection before MRI to help diagnose problems in the liver.

Mangafodipir is injected into a vein. The dose of this agent will be different for different patients depending on the body weight of the person.

This medicine is to be used only by or under the supervision of a doctor.
