Opana ER


Description:
Oxymorphone is used to relieve pain severe enough to require opioid treatment and when other pain medicines did not work well enough or cannot be tolerated. Oxymorphone belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines). It acts in the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain. Many of its side effects are also caused by its actions in the CNS.

When oxymorphone is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming (causing mental or physical dependence). However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by reducing the dose gradually over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.

This medicine is available only under a restricted distribution program called the Opioid Analgesic REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet, Extended Release
-> Tablet

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of oxymorphone in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of oxymorphone in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted effects (eg, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea) and age-related liver, kidney, heart, or lung problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving oxymorphone.

It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits  to make sure this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may needed to check for unwanted effects.

Do not use this medicine if you are using or have used an MAO inhibitor (MAOI) such as isocarboxazid [Marplan®], linezolid [Zyvox®], phenelzine [Nardil®], selegiline [Eldepryl®], tranylcypromine [Parnate®]) within the past 14 days.

This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that can make you drowsy or less alert). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, other allergies, or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, other prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. Check with your doctor before taking any of the other medicines listed above while you are using this medicine .

This medicine may cause sleep-related breathing problems (eg, sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoxemia). Your doctor may decrease your dose if you have sleep apnea while using this medicine.

Using this medicine while you are pregnant may cause neonatal withdrawal syndrome in your newborn baby, which can be life-threatening. Tell your doctor right away if your baby has an abnormal sleep pattern, diarrhea, a high-pitched cry, irritability, shakiness or tremor, weight loss, vomiting, or failure to gain weight.

Call your doctor right away if you have worsening of pain, increased sensitivity to pain, or new pain after taking this medicine. These may be symptoms of opioid-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia.

This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using this medicine.

This medicine may cause adrenal gland problems. Check with your doctor right away if you have darkening of the skin, diarrhea, dizziness, fainting, loss of appetite, mental depression, nausea, skin rash, unusual tiredness or weakness, or vomiting.

Dizziness, lightheadedness, or even fainting may occur when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help lessen this problem. Also, lying down for a while may relieve dizziness or lightheadedness.

Oxymorphone may increase your risk of having serious breathing problems. Check with your doctor right away if you are having difficult or trouble breathing, irregular, fast, slow, or shallow breathing, or pale or blue lips, fingernails, or skin .

Using too much oxymorphone may cause an overdose, which can be life-threatening. Symptoms of an overdose include : change in consciousness, extreme dizziness or weakness, loss of consciousness, pale or blue lips, fingernails, or skin, slow heartbeat or breathing, seizures, trouble breathing, cold, clammy skin, sleepiness or unusual drowsiness. In case of an overdose, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may also give naloxone to treat an overdose.

This medicine may be habit-forming. If you feel that the medicine is not working as well, do not use more than your prescribed dose. Call your doctor for instructions.

Check with your doctor right away if you have anxiety, restlessness, a fast heartbeat, fever, sweating, muscle spasms, twitching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or see or hear things that are not there. These may be symptoms of a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. Your risk may be higher if you also take certain other medicines that affect serotonin levels in your body.

Using this medicine for a long time can cause severe constipation. To prevent this, your doctor may direct you to take laxatives, drink a lot of fluids, or increase the amount of fiber in your diet. Be sure to follow the directions carefully, because continuing constipation can lead to more serious problems.

Before having any kind of surgery (including dental surgery) or emergency treatment, tell the medical doctor or dentist in charge that you are using this medicine. Serious side effects can occur if your medical doctor or dentist gives you certain other medicines without knowing that you are using oxymorphone.

If you have been using this medicine regularly for several weeks or more, do not change your dose or suddenly stop using it without first checking with your doctor . Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are taking before stopping it completely, or to take another narcotic for a while, to lessen the chance of withdrawal side effects (eg, anxiety, fever, nausea, runny nose, stomach cramps, sweating, tremors, or trouble with sleeping).
