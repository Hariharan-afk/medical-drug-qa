Description:
Capecitabine is used alone or in combination with other cancer treatments in patients with colon cancer that has spread (Stage III) to help prevent colon cancer from coming back after surgery. It is also used together with other cancer treatments and radiation treatment, around the time of surgery, to treat rectal cancer that has spread. This medicine is also used alone or in combination with other cancer treatments to treat colorectal cancer that has spread or cannot be removed by surgery.

Capecitabine is also used together with docetaxel to treat breast cancer that has spread throughout the body in patients who have received other medicines (eg, anthracycline medicine) that did not worked well. This medicine is also used alone to treat breast cancer in patients who are not able to receive anthracycline medicine or taxane medicine.

Capecitabine is also used in combination with other cancer treatments to treat esophageal, gastric (stomach), or gastroesophageal junction in patients whose cancer has spread or cannot be removed by surgery. It is also used to treat esophagus, stomach, or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma that has spread throughout the body in patients whose cancer has an abnormal HER2 gene and who have not received other cancer treatments.

Capecitabine is also used in combination with other cancer treatments to prevent pancreatic cancer from coming back after surgery.

Capecitabine belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics (cancer medicines). It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by the medicine, other side effects may also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.

Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.


Precautions:
It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits  to make sure that this medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.

Your doctor may request that you have a test to determine if your blood is clotting properly, and may preform this test frequently if you are also taking a blood thinner.

Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. If you are a woman who can get pregnant, your doctor may do tests to make sure you are not pregnant before taking this medicine. Female patients must use effective birth control during treatment and for 6 months after your treatment ends. Male patients with partners of childbearing potential should also use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose. Tell your doctor right away if you think you have become pregnant.

This medicine may increase risk of bleeding when used together with a blood thinner (eg, warfarin). Check with your doctor right away if you have back pain, blood in the eyes, blood in the urine, black, tarry stools, bruising or purple areas on the skin, coughing up blood, decreased alertness, dizziness, headache, joint pain or swelling, or nosebleeds.

This medicine may cause heart problems. Check with your doctor right away if you have chest pain that may spread to your arms, jaw, back, or neck, chest tightness, decreased urine output, dilated neck veins, faintness, nausea, sweating, swelling in your hands, ankles, or feet, trouble breathing, unusual sweating, vomiting.

This medicine may cause kidney problems. Check with your doctor right away if you have agitation, coma, confusion, decreased urine output, depression, dizziness, headache, hostility, irritability, lethargy, muscle twitching, nausea, rapid weight gain, seizures, stupor, swelling of the face, ankles, or hands, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

Check with your doctor right away if any of the following symptoms occur:

-> Diarrhea, moderately severe (four to six stools a day more than usual, or during the night).
-> Nausea that is severe enough to cause you to eat less than usual.
-> Vomiting two or more times in a 24-hour period.
-> Pain and redness, swelling, or sores or ulcers in your mouth or on your lips that are severe enough to interfere with eating.
If vomiting occurs less often than mentioned above, or if nausea does not cause you to eat less than usual, it is not necessary for you to stop taking the medicine or to check with your doctor (unless these effects are particularly bothersome). Also, you do not need to stop taking the medicine if diarrhea occurs less often than mentioned above or if the other side effects listed are not severe enough to interfere with eating or other daily activities. However, check with your doctor as soon as possible if they occur.

Check with your doctor right away if you have confusion, decreased urination, dizziness, dry mouth, fainting, increase in heart rate, lightheadedness, rapid breathing, sunken eyes, thirst, unusual tiredness or weakness, or wrinkled skin. These may be symptoms of dehydration.

Serious skin reactions (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) can occur with this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, cough, diarrhea, itching, joint or muscle pain, red irritated eyes, red skin lesions, often with a purple center, sore throat, sores, ulcers, or white spots in the mouth or on the lips, unusual tiredness or weakness, or fever or chills while you are using this medicine.

This medicine may cause a serious skin problem called palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome. Check with your doctor if you have a rash that does not go away or redness, pain, swelling, or blisters on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet.

While you are being treated with capecitabine, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Capecitabine may lower your body's resistance and the vaccine may not work as well or you might get the infection the vaccine is meant to prevent. In addition, you should not be around other persons living in your household who receive live virus vaccines because there is a chance they could pass the virus on to you. Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.

Capecitabine can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

-> If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
-> Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
-> Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
-> Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
-> Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
-> Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.
Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
