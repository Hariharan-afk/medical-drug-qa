Description:
Blinatumomab injection is used to treat B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in remission with minimal residual disease (MRD). It is also used to treat ALL that has come back or after other medicines did not work well. This medicine is also used to treat Philadelphia chromosome negative precursor ALL in consolidation phase of chemotherapy treatment. Leukemia is a type of cancer where the body makes abnormal white blood cells.

Blinatumomab injection is an antineoplastic (cancer) medicine. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by blinatumomab, other side effects can occur. Before you begin treatment, talk to your doctor about the benefits of this medicine as well as the possible risks of using it.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
