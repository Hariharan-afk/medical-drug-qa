Description:
Omalizumab injection is used to treat moderate to severe persistent allergic asthma. It is used when a patient's asthma has not been controlled sufficiently on other asthma medicines. This medicine will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started. Your doctor will perform a skin or blood test to check if you have allergies to year-round allergens.

Omalizumab injection is also used to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) in patients who have tried other medicines (eg, nasal corticosteroids) but they did not work well enough.

Omalizumab injection is also used to treat food allergy. It is used to reduce allergic reactions that may occur after accidentally eating one or more foods to which you are allergic.

Omalizumab injection is also used to treat chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) in patients who continue to have hives that are not controlled by an antihistamine (allergy medicine).

Omalizumab is a medicine called an IgE blocker. IgE is short for immunoglobulin E, a substance that occurs naturally in the body in small amounts. This substance plays an important role in allergic asthma. When people with allergic asthma breathe in a year-round allergen, such as cat or dog dander, their bodies make more IgE. This may cause a series of reactions in your body that can lead to asthma attacks and symptoms. Omalizumab works by helping to block IgE.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Solution
-> Powder for Solution

If you are receiving this medicine  for asthma or nasal polyps , you will receive omalizumab once every 2 or 4 weeks. Your dose will be determined by your IgE level, which your doctor will measure with a simple blood test before treatment begins, and your body weight. Based on your dose, your doctor will also tell you if you will need 1, 2, or 3 injections per dose. If you need more than 1 injection, each will be given in a different place on your body.

Omalizumab is not a rescue medication and should not be used to treat sudden asthma attacks. It is not a substitute for the medicines you are already taking. Never suddenly stop taking, or change the dose of your steroid medicine (inhaled or taken by mouth) unless your doctor tells you to do so.

If you are receiving this medicine for  chronic idiopathic urticaria , you will receive this medicine every 4 weeks.

Omalizumab injection may also be given at home to patients who have received at least 3 doses of this medicine under the supervision of a doctor. If you are using this medicine at home, your doctor or nurse will teach you how to inject the medicine. Be sure that you understand exactly how to use this.

If you use this medicine at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems. Do not inject into scars, moles, or skin areas that are red, bruised, tender, hard, or not intact.

The second click tells you that the injection is almost complete. You will see the green indicator stop moving and completely fill the viewing window. If the window has not turned green, this means you may not have received the full dose.
