Description:
Gadopentetate injection is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent that is used to help create a clear picture of the body during an MRI scan. MRI scans are a special kind of diagnostic procedure that use magnets and computers to create images or “pictures” of certain areas inside the body. Unlike x-rays, they do not involve radiation. Gadopentetate is a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA).

Gadopentetate is given by injection before MRI to help diagnose problems in the brain, spine, head, neck, tissues, and other parts of your body.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.
