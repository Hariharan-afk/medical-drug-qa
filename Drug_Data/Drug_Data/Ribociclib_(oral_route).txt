Description:
Ribociclib is used to treat hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)-negative breast cancer. It is used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor to treat stage II and III early breast cancer with a high risk of coming back. This medicine is also used to treat advanced (has gotten worse) or metastatic (has spread throughout the body) breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as the first endocrine-based treatment or with fulvestrant as the first endocrine-based treatment or after disease has gotten worse on endocrine treatment.

Ribociclib belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by the medicine, other unwanted effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
