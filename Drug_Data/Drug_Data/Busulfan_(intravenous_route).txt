Description:
Busulfan injection is used in combination with cyclophosphamide as a conditioning regimen prior to allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation for treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia.

Busulfan belongs to the group of medicines known as alkylating agents. It seems to act by interfering with the function of the bone marrow. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by busulfan, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects may not occur for months or years after the medicine is used.

Before you begin treatment with busulfan, you and your doctor should talk about the benefits this medicine will do as well as the risks of using it.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

Precautions:
It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits  to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep you or your sexual partner from getting pregnant during or after treatment. If you think you have become pregnant while using this medicine, tell your doctor right away.

Busulfan can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

-> If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
-> Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
-> Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
-> Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
-> Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
-> Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.
This medicine may cause hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HVOD). This usually occurs if you receive too much busulfan, or receive this medicine before radiation treatment, or have a prior progenitor cell transplant. Call your doctor right away if you have a bloated abdomen or stomach, upper right abdominal or stomach pain, weight gain, or yellow eyes or skin.

While you are being treated with busulfan, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. Busulfan may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent. In addition, other persons living in your household should not take oral polio vaccine since there is a chance they could pass the polio virus on to you. Also, avoid persons who have taken oral polio vaccine within the last several months. Do not get close to them, and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.

Before you have any medical tests, tell the medical doctor in charge that you are using this medicine. The results of some body tissue studies may be affected by this medicine.

Talk with your doctor before using this medicine if you plan to have children. Some men who use this medicine have become infertile (unable to have children).

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
