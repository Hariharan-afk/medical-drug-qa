Description:
Goserelin is a hormone similar to the one normally released from the hypothalamus gland in the brain. It is used to treat a number of medical problems. These include:

-> Cancer of the prostate in men
-> Cancer of the breast in women if it develops before or around the time of menopause
-> Endometriosis, a painful condition caused by extra tissue growing inside or outside of the uterus, and
-> Thinning of the lining of the uterus before surgery on the uterus.
When given regularly as an implant, goserelin works every day to decrease the amount of estrogen and testosterone in the blood.

Reducing the amount of estrogen in the body is one way of treating endometriosis and cancer of the breast, and can help thin the uterus lining before surgery. Goserelin prevents the growth of tissue associated with endometriosis in adult women during treatment and for up to 6 months after treatment is discontinued.

Reducing the amount of testosterone in the body is one way of treating cancer of the prostate.

Suppressing estrogen can thin the bones or slow their growth. This is a problem for adult women whose bones are no longer growing like the bones of children. This is why goserelin is used only for up to 6 months in adult women treated for endometriosis.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Implant
