Description:
Budesonide and formoterol combination is used to help control the symptoms of asthma and improve lung function. It is used when a patient's asthma has not been controlled sufficiently on other asthma medicines, or when a patient's condition is so severe that more than one medicine is needed every day.

Budesonide and formoterol combination is also used as long-term maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. This medicine helps improve and reduce the number of flare-ups of the symptoms of COPD.

Inhaled budesonide belongs to the family of medicines known as corticosteroids (cortisone-like medicines). It works by preventing inflammation (swelling) in the lungs that causes an asthma attack.

Formoterol belongs to the family of medicines known as long-acting bronchodilators. Bronchodilators are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. They relieve cough, wheezing, and trouble breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

Inhaled fluticasone and salmeterol is used to prevent asthma attacks and treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is not used to relieve an asthma attack that has already started. For relief of an asthma attack that has already started, you should use another medicine. If you do not have another medicine to use for an attack or if you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.

This medicine comes with a patient information leaflet or patient instructions. Read the directions carefully before using this medicine. If you do not understand the directions or you are not sure how to use the inhaler, ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you what to do. Also, ask your doctor to check regularly how you use the inhaler to make sure you are using it properly.

In order for this medicine to help prevent asthma attacks, it must be used every day in regularly spaced doses, as ordered by your doctor .

When you use the  Symbicort® inhaler  for the first time, or if you have not used it for 7 days or longer, or if the inhaler has been dropped, it may not deliver the right amount of medicine with the first inhalation. Therefore, before using the inhaler, prime it by spraying the medicine 2 times into the air away from the face, and shaking it well for 5 seconds before each spray.

To use the  Symbicort® inhaler :

-> Take the inhaler out of the moisture-protective foil pouch before you use it for the first time.
-> Do not use the inhaler for this medicine with any other medicine.
-> Prime the inhaler before use by shaking the inhaler well for 5 seconds and then releasing a test spray. Once again, shake the inhaler and release a second test spray.
-> Breathe out to the end of a normal breath (exhale). Do not breathe into the inhaler.
-> Put the mouthpiece fully into your mouth and close your lips around it. Do not block the mouthpiece with your teeth or tongue.
-> While pressing down firmly and fully on the grey top of the inhaler, breathe in through your mouth as deeply as you can until you have taken a full deep breath.
-> Hold your breath and remove the mouthpiece from your mouth. Continue holding your breath for as long as you can up to 10 seconds before breathing out slowly. This gives the medicine time to settle in your airways and lungs.
-> Release your finger from the grey top and then turn your head away from the inhaler. Breathe out slowly to the end of a normal breath. Do not breathe into the inhaler.
-> Shake the inhaler again for 5 seconds and take the second inhalation following exactly the same steps you used for the first inhalation.
