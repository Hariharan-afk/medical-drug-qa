Description:
Glyburide is used to treat high blood sugar levels caused by type 2 diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, your body does not work properly to store excess sugar and the sugar remains in your bloodstream. Chronic high blood sugar can lead to serious health problems in the future.

Proper diet is the first step in managing type 2 diabetes, but often medicines are needed to help your body. Glyburide belongs to a class of medicines called sulfonylureas. It causes your pancreas to release more insulin into the blood stream. This medicine may be used alone or with another oral medicine such as metformin.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet

Pediatric:
