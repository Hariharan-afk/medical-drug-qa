Urso Forte


Description:
Ursodiol is used to dissolve gallstones in patients who do not need to have their gallbladders removed or in those in whom surgery should be avoided because of other medical problems. However, ursodiol works only in those patients whose gallstones are made of cholesterol and works best when these stones are small and of the “floating” type. It is also used to help prevent gallstones in patients who are on rapid weight-loss programs.

Ursodiol is also used to treat primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). PBC is an autoimmune disorder that causes a patient's liver to have problems and not work properly.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

Allergies:

Proper Use:
