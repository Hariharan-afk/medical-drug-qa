Kapidex


Description:
Dexlansoprazole is used to treat certain conditions in which there is too much acid in the stomach. It is used to treat erosive esophagitis or "heartburn" caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition where the acid in the stomach washes back up into the esophagus.

Dexlansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It works by decreasing the amount of acid produced by the stomach.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

On October 17, 2017, Dexilant Solutab® (delayed-release disintegrating tablets) was withdrawn from the US market. Dexilant® and Kapidex® (delayed-release capsules) are still available.
