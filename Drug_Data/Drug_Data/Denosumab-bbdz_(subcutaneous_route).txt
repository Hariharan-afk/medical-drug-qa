Description:
Denosumab-bbdz injection is used to treat osteoporosis (thinning of the bones) in women who have an increased risk for fractures after menopause, and osteoporosis in men. It is given when other medicines cannot be used or after other medicines did not work well. It is also used to treat osteoporosis in patients using steroid medicines for at least 6 months.

Denosumab-bbdz injection is also used to treat bone loss in males with nonmetastatic (has not spread) prostate cancer and females with nonmetastatic breast cancer who are at high risk for fracture after receiving cancer treatment.

Denosumab-bbdz injection is also used to prevent bone problems in patients with multiple myeloma and bone metastases (cancer that has spread) from solid tumors. This medicine is also used to treat giant cell tumor of the bone that cannot be removed by surgery or when surgery is too risky. It is also used to treat hypercalcemia (high calcium in the blood) associated with cancer that did not respond to bisphosphonate treatment.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor.
