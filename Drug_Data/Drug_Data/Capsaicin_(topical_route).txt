Description:
Capsaicin is used to help relieve a certain type of pain known as neuralgia (shooting or burning pain in the nerves). Capsaicin is also used to help relieve minor pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis or muscle sprains and strains.  Qutenza® patch  is also used to treat nerve pain caused by diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the feet. It will not cure any of these conditions.

Neuralgia is a pain that comes from the nerves near the surface of your skin. This pain may occur after an infection with herpes zoster (shingles or postherpetic neuralgia). Capsaicin will help relieve the pain of postherpetic neuralgia, but it will not cure the condition.

Qutenza®  is to be given only by your doctor.  Zostrix®  is available both over-the-counter (OTC) and with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Cream
-> Lotion
-> Patch, Extended Release
-> Solution
