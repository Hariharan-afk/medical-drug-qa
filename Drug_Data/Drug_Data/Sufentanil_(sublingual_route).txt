Description:
Sufentanil sublingual tablet is used to relieve pain severe enough to require opioid treatment and when other pain medicines did not work well enough or cannot be tolerated. This medicine should only be used for up to 72 hours. Sufentanil belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines) that act on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain.

When sufentanil is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. Since sufentanil is only used for short-term (72 hours or less) relief of pain, physical dependence will probably not occur.

This medicine is available only under a restricted distribution program called the Dsuvia™ REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet

Allergies:
The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.

The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.


Pediatric:
