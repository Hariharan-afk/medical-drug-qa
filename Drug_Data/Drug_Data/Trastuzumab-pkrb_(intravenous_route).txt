Description:
Trastuzumab-pkrb injection is used together with other cancer medicines (eg, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and either paclitaxel or docetaxel, or docetaxel and carboplatin) or used alone following anthracycline-based therapy to treat HER2-overexpressing node-positive or node-negative (ER/PR negative or with one high risk feature) breast cancer.

Trastuzumab-pkrb injection is also used to treat HER2-overexpressing metastatic (cancer that has spread) breast cancer in patients who have received one or more chemotherapy treatments. It is also used together with paclitaxel for the first-line treatment of HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.

Trastuzumab-pkrb injection is also used together with cisplatin and capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil to treat HER2-overexpressing metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma (stomach or esophagus cancer) in patients who have not received other cancer treatments.

Trastuzumab-pkrb prevents the growth of some tumors that produce extra amounts of a certain substance known as the HER2 protein.  It should only be used in patients whose tumors have been shown to produce extra amounts of this protein (HER2 overexpression) .

Trastuzumab-pkrb is a monoclonal antibody. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by trastuzumab-pkrb, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
