If you are taking some of these medicines by mouth, ask your health care professional to help you plan a way to take them at the right times.

Cisplatin can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

-> If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
-> Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
-> Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
-> Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
-> Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
-> Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.
Check with your doctor right away if you have dizziness, loss of balance, loss of hearing, ringing or buzzing in the ears, or troubled hearing. These could be symptoms of hearing or ear problems.

Call your doctor right away if blurred vision, difficulty with reading, or any other change in vision occurs during or after treatment. These could be symptoms of eye problems (eg, optical neuritis, papilledema, cortical blindness).

This medicine may increase your risk for other cancers, including leukemia. Tell your doctor right away if you have bone or joint pain, fever, pale skin, unusual bleeding or bruising, unusual tiredness or weakness, weight loss, or swollen lymph glands in the neck, armpit, groin, or stomach.

If cisplatin accidentally seeps out of the vein into which it is injected, it may damage some tissues and cause scarring. Tell the doctor or nurse right away if you notice redness, pain, or swelling at the place of injection.
