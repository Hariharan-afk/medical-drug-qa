USBrand Name:
Carbaglu


Description:
Carglumic acid is used together with diet and other medicines to treat and prevent hyperammonemia (too much ammonia in the blood) caused by the lack of a liver enzyme called N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS). It is also used together with diet and other medicines to prevent hyperammonemia caused by certain genetic disorders called propionic acidemia (PA) or methylmalonic acidemia (MMA).

Ammonia is formed in the body when we digest protein. A person without the NAGS enzyme cannot process ammonia properly, and too much ammonia will collect in the blood. This will cause serious unwanted effects. Carglumic acid acts by replacing the NAGS enzyme and helps reduce the amount of ammonia in the blood.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
