CanadianBrand Name:
Bcg Vaccine Freeze Dried


Description:
Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is given by injection to help prevent tuberculosis (TB). TB is a serious disease that can cause severe illness. It is spread by close contact with people who already have TB, such as people living in the same house. Some infected people do not appear to be sick, but they can still spread TB to others. BCG vaccine does not provide 100% protection. Therefore it is important to avoid people with TB, even if you have received the vaccine.

BCG vaccine is to be administered only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.


Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
BCG vaccine has been used widely in children, and it has not been reported to cause different side effects or problems in children than it does in adults.


Geriatric:
Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of BCG vaccine in the elderly with use in other age groups.

There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.
