Description:
Ertugliflozin and metformin combination is used with proper diet and exercise to treat high blood sugar levels caused by type 2 diabetes in patients who are already using ertugliflozin and metformin for treatment or who do not have control of their blood sugar on ertugliflozin or metformin alone.

Ertugliflozin works in the kidneys to prevent absorption of glucose (blood sugar). This helps lower the blood sugar level. Metformin reduces the absorption of sugar from the stomach, reduces the release of stored sugar from the liver, and helps your body use sugar better. This medicine does not help patients who have insulin-dependent or type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetic patients must use insulin injections.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:
