Mifeprex


Description:
Mifepristone is used in a regimen together with misoprostol to end a pregnancy that is less than 70 days in duration. It works by stopping the supply of hormones that maintains the interior of the uterus. Without these hormones, the uterus cannot support the pregnancy and the contents of the uterus are expelled.

Mifepristone is also used to control high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) caused by high cortisol levels in the blood (hypercortisolism) in patients with Cushing's syndrome who also have type 2 diabetes and have failed surgery or who cannot have surgery.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription and only under a restricted distribution program called Mifepristone REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) Program.
