Pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and hyaluronidase-zzxf combination injection is used first together with other cancer medicines to treat HER2-positive, locally advanced, inflammatory, or early stage breast cancer (either greater than 2 centimeters in diameter or node positive) as part of a complete treatment plan for early breast cancer. It is also used after an initial treatment plan to treat HER2-positive early breast cancer which has a high risk of occurring again.

It should only be used in patients whose tumors have been shown to produce extra amounts of this protein (HER2 overexpression) .
