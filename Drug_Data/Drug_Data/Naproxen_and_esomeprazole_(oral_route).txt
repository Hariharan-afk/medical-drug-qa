Description:
Naproxen and esomeprazole combination is used to relieve the symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis in adults and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in children. It is used for patients who have an increased risk for stomach ulcers and who need to take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis.

Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used to treat pain, inflammation, swelling, stiffness, and joint pain. Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that is used to treat certain conditions where too much acid is produced in the stomach (eg, duodenal and gastric ulcers).

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.
