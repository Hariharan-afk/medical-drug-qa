Lenvatinib is used to treat progressive, differentiated thyroid cancer that can no longer be treated with radioactive iodine and has already spread to different parts of the body.

Lenvatinib is also used in combination with pembrolizumab injection as first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a kind of kidney cancer, in patients whose cancer has spread or cannot be removed by surgery. This medicine is also used in combination with everolimus to treat advanced kidney cancer in patients who have previously received one course of treatment with another cancer medicine.

Lenvatinib is also used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma, a type of liver cancer, that cannot be removed by surgery.

Lenvatinib is also used in combination with pembrolizumab injection to treat advanced endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the uterus or womb) that is mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) or not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) in patients who have received other cancer medicines that did not work well and are not candidates for surgery or radiation.
