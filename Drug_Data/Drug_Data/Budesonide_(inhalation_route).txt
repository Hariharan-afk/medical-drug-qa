Description:
Budesonide is used to help prevent the symptoms of asthma. When used regularly every day, inhaled budesonide decreases the number and severity of asthma attacks. However, it will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.

Budesonide is a corticosteroid or steroid (cortisone-like medicine). It works by preventing inflammation (swelling) in the lungs, which makes the asthma attack less severe. Inhaled budesonide may be used with other asthma medicines such as bronchodilators, which are also used to open up narrowed breathing passages in the lungs.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Suspension
-> Powder

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

When using the  Pulmicort Flexhaler™ :

-> This medicine comes as a powder that you breathe into the lungs with a special inhaler that is placed in the mouth. It is used by adults, teenagers, and children who are 6 years of age and older.
-> The medicine comes with patient instructions. Read the instructions carefully before using this medicine. If you or your child do not understand the instructions or are not sure how to use the inhaler, check with your doctor.
-> When you use the inhaler for the first time, it may not deliver the right amount of medicine with the first puff. Before using this medicine, test or prime it.
-> Hold the inhaler so that the white cover points up, then twist the cover and lift it off. Hold the inhaler upright (mouthpiece up) using the brown grip, then twist the middle of the inhaler fully in one direction as far as it will go, and then back again in the other direction. You will hear a click. Repeat this process one more time.
-> You do not have to prime it again after this, even if you have not used it for a long time.
-> After the inhaler is primed, twist the cover and lift it off.
-> To load a dose, hold the inhaler in the upright position, then twist the grip fully in one direction as far as it will go, and then fully back again in the other direction. You will hear a click.
-> Turn your head away from the inhaler and breathe out. Do not shake the inhaler.
-> Place the mouthpiece between your lips and breathe in deeply and forcefully. You may not taste or feel the medicine.
-> Do not chew or bite on the mouthpiece.
-> Remove the inhaler from your mouth and breathe out. Do not blow or breathe into the inhaler.
-> Repeat these steps if more than one dose is needed.
-> When you are finished, place the cover back on the inhaler and twist shut. Rinse your mouth with water and spit out the water. Do not swallow the water. This helps prevent hoarseness, throat irritation, and infections in the mouth.
-> Do not use the inhaler if it has been damaged or if the mouthpiece has become detached.
-> Do not use a spacer with the Pulmicort Flexhaler™.
-> Keep the inhaler clean and dry at all times. Follow the patient directions for cleaning and storing the inhaler.
-> The inhaler has a dose indicator that keeps track of how many times you can use the inhaler before you need to open a new one. Check the dose indicator just below the mouthpiece. The dose indicator usually starts with either the number 60 or 120 when full.
-> Discard the whole device when all doses have been used. The inhaler is empty when the number zero appears in the middle of the dose indicator window. You will be given a new inhaler each time you refill your prescription.
When using the  Pulmicort Respules®  liquid:

-> This medicine comes as a liquid that you breathe into the lungs with a special breathing machine called a jet nebulizer. The nebulizer has a face mask or mouthpiece. It is used by children who are 12 months to 8 years of age.
-> Your doctor will tell you which type of nebulizer to use with this medicine and will show you how to use the nebulizer. The medicine and nebulizer come with patient instructions. Read the instructions carefully before using the medicine or the machine. If you or your child do not understand the instructions or are not sure how to use the nebulizer, check with your doctor.
-> Use this medicine at the same time each day, unless your child's doctor tells you otherwise.
-> Do not mix this liquid with other medicines.
-> Open the sealed aluminum foil envelope containing the medicine. Remove one container from the strip of five plastic containers with sealed caps. Write the current date on the back of the envelope when you open the foil pouch.
-> Each container has one dose of medicine.
-> Place the unused containers back in the foil pouch. This will protect the medicine from light.
-> Shake the container in a circular motion before using it.
-> Hold the container upright and open it by twisting off the cap.
-> Slowly squeeze out all of the contents of the container into the nebulizer cup. Throw the empty container away.
-> If your child is using a face mask, make sure that the mask fits tightly on the face to avoid getting the medicine in the eyes.
-> Turn on the compressor to begin nebulizing the medication. The nebulizer turns the medicine into a fine mist that the child breathes into the lungs using the mouthpiece or mask.
-> After the dose is completed, wash your child's face to prevent skin irritation.
-> Rinsing your child's mouth with water after each dose may help prevent hoarseness, throat irritation, and infections in the mouth. Do not allow your child to swallow the water after rinsing.
