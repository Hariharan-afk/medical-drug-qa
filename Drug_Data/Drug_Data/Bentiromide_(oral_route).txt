Description:
Bentiromide is used to help find out if the pancreas is working the way it should. The pancreas helps break down the bentiromide almost the same way it helps to break down food.

After bentiromide is broken down, a part of it appears in the urine. By measuring how much appears in the urine, your doctor can tell how well your pancreas is working.

How the test is done: Bentiromide is given by mouth as a single dose. After you take bentiromide, all of your urine is collected for the next six hours. The total amount is measured and a small sample is saved and examined. Your doctor may repeat the test after seven days.

This medicine was withdrawn from the U.S. market in October 1996.
