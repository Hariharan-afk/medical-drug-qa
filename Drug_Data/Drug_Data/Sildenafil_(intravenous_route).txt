Description:
Sildenafil injection is used to treat the symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension. This is a type of high blood pressure that occurs between the heart and the lungs. When hypertension occurs in the lungs, the heart must work harder to pump enough blood through the lungs.

Sildenafil belongs to a group of medicines called phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. It works on the PDE5 enzyme in the lungs to relax the blood vessels. This will increase the supply of blood to the lungs and reduce the workload of the heart.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
