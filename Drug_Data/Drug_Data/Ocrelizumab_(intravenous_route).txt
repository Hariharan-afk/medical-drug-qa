Precautions:
It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits  to make sure this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for any unwanted effects.

This medicine may cause a rare but serious type of an allergic reaction called an infusion reaction. This can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you start to have a cough, difficulty with swallowing, sore throat, dizziness, headache, nausea, fast heartbeat, trouble breathing, chest tightness, swelling in your face or hands, fever, chills, skin itching, redness, rash, or hives, lightheadedness or faintness, or unusual tiredness or weakness while you are receiving this medicine.

Receiving this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant during treatment with this medicine and for 6 months after the last dose. If you think you have become pregnant while receiving this medicine, tell your doctor right away.

This medicine may increase your risk of developing serious infections (eg, bacterial, fungal, parasitic, viral). Avoid being near people who are sick or have infections while you are using this medicine. Wash your hands often. Also tell your doctor if you have ever had an infection that would not go away or an infection that kept coming back.

Check with your doctor right away if you have ear congestion, chills, cough, chest tightness, fever, sneezing, sore throat, body aches or pain, headache, loss of voice, runny or stuffy nose, unusual tiredness or weakness, or trouble breathing. These could be symptoms of a lung infection.

This medicine may increase your risk for herpes infection. Tell your doctor right away if you have a fever, blistering, burning, crusting, irritation, itching, reddening, stinging, or swelling of the skin, painful cold sores, or blisters on the lips, nose, eyes, genitals, or trunk of the body, skin rash, pain, or itching, changes in vision, confusion, eye pain or redness, headache, or stiff neck.

Check with your doctor if you have weakness on one side of the body, clumsiness, blurred vision, changes in thinking, memory problems, confusion, or personality changes. These could be symptoms of a serious and rare brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).

This medicine may cause hepatitis B virus reactivation. Tell your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of liver problems, such as yellow skin or eyes, dark brown-colored urine, right-sided stomach pain, fever, or severe tiredness.

While you are being treated with ocrelizumab, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. You may receive live or live-attenuated vaccines at least 4 weeks or non-live vaccines at least 2 weeks before starting this medicine. Ocrelizumab may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent. In addition, other persons living in your household should not take oral polio vaccine since there is a chance they could pass the polio virus on to you. Also, avoid persons who have taken oral polio vaccine within the last several months. Do not get close to them, and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.

Using this medicine may increase your risk of getting cancer (eg, breast cancer). Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this risk.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
