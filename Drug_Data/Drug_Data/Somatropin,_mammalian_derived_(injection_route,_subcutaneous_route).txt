Description:
Somatropin injection is used to treat growth hormone deficiency (inability to produce enough growth hormone), chronic kidney disease, idiopathic short stature (unexplained shortness), Turner syndrome, short stature homeobox-containing gene (SHOX) deficiency, and short stature born small for gestational age (SGA) with no catch-up growth by age 2 to 4 years of age. This medicine is a man-made version of the human growth hormone. Growth hormone is naturally produced by the pituitary gland and is necessary to stimulate growth in children.

Somatropin injection is also used together with a proper diet to treat short bowel syndrome (SBS), which is a condition that prevents the intestine or gut from absorbing food properly.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
