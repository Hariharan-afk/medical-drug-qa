Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of pembrolizumab injection in children 12 years of age with melanoma or in children with lymphoma, solid tumors, colorectal cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma, microsatellite instability-high cancer, or tumor mutational burden-high cancer. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children with other cancers.
