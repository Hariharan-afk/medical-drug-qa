Cysteamine is used to prevent damage that may be caused by the buildup of cystine crystals in organs such as the kidneys (nephropathic cystinosis). Cystinosis is a hereditary disorder that causes an accumulation of the amino acid cystine within cells, forming crystals that can build up and damage the kidneys. This medicine works by removing the extra cystine from the cells of the body.
