Precautions:
It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits  to see if the medicine is working properly and to check for any unwanted effects.

For patients using the Epsolay®  topical cream:

-> This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor right away if you have chest tightness, cough, difficulty swallowing, dizziness, fast heartbeat, hives, itching, or skin rash, large, hive-like swelling on face, eyelids, lips, tongue, throat, hands, legs, feet, or sex organs, trouble breathing, or unusual tiredness or weakness.
-> Serious skin reactions (eg, skin irritation, contact dermatitis) including pain, irritation, itching, burning, redness, peeling, dryness, scaling, or stinging of the skin can occur during treatment with this medicine. Your doctor may tell you to use a moisturizer to treat skin irritation.
-> This medicine may make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. Use a sunscreen and wear loose-fitting clothes when you are outdoors. Avoid sunlamps and tanning beds.
During the first 3 weeks you are using benzoyl peroxide, your skin may become irritated. Also, your acne may seem to get worse before it gets better. If your skin problem has not improved within 4 to 6 weeks, check with your doctor.

Certain over-the-counter (OTC) acne products may cause rare and life-threatening allergic reactions. Check with your doctor right away if you have hives, itching, trouble breathing, swelling of the eyes, face, lips, or tongue, tightness in the throat, or feeling faint while using these acne products.

Do not use an OTC acne product again if you have developed a serious allergic reaction from it.

Avoid using any other topical medicine on the same area within 1 hour before or after using benzoyl peroxide. Otherwise, benzoyl peroxide may not work properly.

Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, it is especially important to avoid using the following skin products on the same area as benzoyl peroxide:

-> Any other topical acne product or skin product containing a peeling agent (eg, resorcinol, salicylic acid, sulfur, or tretinoin);
-> Hair products that are irritating, such as permanents or hair removal products;
-> Skin products that cause sensitivity to the sun, such as those containing lime or spices;
-> Skin products containing a large amount of alcohol, such as astringents, shaving creams, or after-shave lotions; or
-> Skin products that are too drying or abrasive, such as some cosmetics, soaps, or skin cleansers.
Using these products along with benzoyl peroxide may cause mild to severe irritation of the skin. Although skin irritation can occur, some doctors sometimes allow benzoyl peroxide to be used with tretinoin to treat acne. Usually tretinoin is applied at night so that it doesn't cause a problem with any other topical products that you might use during the day. Check with your doctor before using any other topical medicines with benzoyl peroxide.

Check with your doctor at any time your skin becomes too dry or irritated. Your doctor can help you choose the right skin products for you to reduce skin dryness and irritation.
