Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.

Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of diazepam nasal spray in children younger than 6 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established. Diazepam nasal spray should not be used in infants and babies.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of diazepam nasal spray in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted effects (eg, severe drowsiness, dizziness, clumsiness, or unsteadiness), which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving diazepam nasal spray.
