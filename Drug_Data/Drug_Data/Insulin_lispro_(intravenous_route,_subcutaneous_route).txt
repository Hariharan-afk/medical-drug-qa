Description:
Insulin lispro is a fast-acting type of insulin. Insulin is one of many hormones that helps the body turn the food we eat into energy. This is done by using the glucose (sugar) in the blood as quick energy. Also, insulin helps us store energy that we can use for later. When you have diabetes mellitus, your body cannot make enough or does not use insulin properly. So, you must take additional insulin to regulate your blood sugar and keep your body healthy. This is very important as too much sugar in your blood can be harmful to your health.

Insulin lispro starts to work faster than some other types of insulin, and its effects do not last as long. It should act more like the insulin your body would normally produce. Because the effects of insulin lispro are short-acting, your doctor may also prescribe a longer-acting insulin for you to use.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Solution

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of insulin lispro in children 3 years of age and older. However, safety and efficacy of insulin lispro have not been established in children younger than 3 years of age or with type 2 diabetes.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of insulin lispro in the elderly.

Proper Use:
A nurse or other trained health professional may give you this medicine. You may also be taught how to give your medicine at home. This medicine is given as a shot under your skin or into a vein.

Always double-check both the concentration (strength) of your insulin  and  your dose.  Concentration and dose are not the same.  The dose is how many units of insulin you will use. The concentration tells how many units of insulin are in each milliliter (mL), such as 100 units/mL (U-100), but this does not mean you will use 100 units at a time.

Each package of insulin lispro contains a patient information leaflet and patient instructions. Read this leaflet carefully and make sure you understand:

-> How to prepare the medicine.
-> How to inject the medicine.
-> How to use a disposable insulin delivery device.
-> How to use an external insulin pump.
-> How and when to change the infusion set, cartridge adapter, and insulin in the external insulin pump reservoir.
-> How and when to change the insulin lispro 3 mL cartridge.
-> How to dispose of syringes, needles, and injection devices.
It is best to use a different place on the body for each injection (eg, under the skin of your stomach, thigh, buttocks, or upper arm).  Do not use the exact same spot for each injection . If you have questions about this, contact a member of your health care team.

Do not inject into skin areas that are tender, bruised, scaly, hard, damaged, thick, or has pits, lumps, or scars.

When used as a mealtime insulin, it should be taken within 15 minutes before a meal or immediately after a meal.

The insulin solution should look clear and colorless. Do not use insulin lispro if it is cloudy or thickened, discolored, or if there are particles in it. Do not mix this medicine with any other insulin. If you are told to mix lispro with a longer-acting insulin, draw up insulin lispro into the syringe first, then the longer-acting insulin. Inject it right away.

When used in an  insulin pump : Carefully read and follow the external insulin pump instructions. This insulin should not be mixed with any other insulin or diluted when used in an insulin pump. The insulin lispro in the pump should be changed at least every 7 days and the infusion set and insertion site changed at least every 3 days. If you do not understand how you are to use the insulin pump or have concerns, contact your doctor or pharmacist.

Check with your doctor immediately if you are rapidly gaining weight, chest pain or discomfort, extreme tiredness or weakness, trouble breathing, uneven heartbeat, or excessive swelling of the hands, wrist, ankles, or feet.

Too much insulin lispro can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Low blood sugar can also occur if you use insulin lispro with another antidiabetic medicine, changes in insulin regimen (eg, insulin strength, type of insulin, injection site), delay or miss a meal or snack, exercise more than usual, drink alcohol, or cannot eat because of nausea or vomiting or have diarrhea. Low blood sugar must be treated before it causes you to pass out (unconsciousness). People feel different symptoms of low blood sugar . It is important that you learn which symptoms you usually have so that you can treat it quickly. Talk to your doctor about the best way to treat low blood sugar.

Symptoms of low blood sugar include anxiety, behavior change similar to being drunk, blurred vision, cold sweats, confusion, depression, difficulty in thinking, dizziness or lightheadedness, drowsiness, excessive hunger, fast heartbeat, headache, irritability or abnormal behavior, nervousness, nightmares, restless sleep, shakiness, slurred speech, and tingling in the hands, feet, lips, or tongue.

If symptoms of low blood sugar occur, eat glucose tablets or gel, corn syrup, honey, or sugar cubes, or drink fruit juice, non-diet soft drink, or sugar dissolved in water to relieve the symptoms. Also, check your blood for low blood sugar. Go to a doctor or a hospital right away if the symptoms do not improve. Someone should call for emergency help immediately if severe symptoms, such as convulsions (seizures) or unconsciousness occur. Have a glucagon kit available, along with a syringe and needle, and know how to use it. Members of your household should also know how to use it.

Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) may occur if you do not take enough or skip a dose of your antidiabetic medicine or insulin, changes in insulin regimen, you overeat or do not follow your meal plan, have a fever or infection, or do not exercise as much as usual. High blood sugar can be very serious and must be treated right away. It is important that you learn which symptoms you have in order to treat it quickly. Talk to your doctor about the best way to treat high blood sugar.

Symptoms of high blood sugar include blurred vision, drowsiness, dry mouth, flushed, dry skin, fruit-like breath odor, increased urination, ketones in the urine, loss of appetite, stomachache, nausea or vomiting, tiredness, trouble breathing (rapid and deep), unconsciousness, and unusual thirst. If these symptoms occur, check your blood sugar level and then call your doctor for instructions.
