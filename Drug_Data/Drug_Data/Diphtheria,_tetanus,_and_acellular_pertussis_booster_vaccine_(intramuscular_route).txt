Description:
Diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis booster vaccine (also known as Tdap) is a combination immunizing agent used to protect against infections caused by diphtheria, tetanus (lockjaw), and pertussis (whooping cough). This vaccine is given to children 10 years of age and older, to women in their third trimester of pregnancy to prevent pertussis in babies younger than 2 months of age, and to adults who have already been given this vaccine in the past. The vaccine will "boost" or increase the protection that the patient had from an earlier dose.

Diphtheria is a serious illness that can cause breathing difficulties, heart problems, nerve damage, pneumonia, and possibly death. The risk of serious complications and death is greater in very young children and in the elderly.

Tetanus (also known as lockjaw) is a serious illness that causes convulsions (seizures) and severe muscle spasms that can be strong enough to cause bone fractures of the spine. Tetanus causes death in 30 to 40 percent of cases.

Pertussis (also known as whooping cough) is a serious disease that causes severe spells of coughing that can interfere with breathing. Pertussis can also cause pneumonia, long-lasting bronchitis, seizures, brain damage, and death.

Children 10 years of age and older, and adults, may need an additional immunization called a booster against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. Adults and teenagers should receive Tdap instead of the tetanus-diphtheria (Td) injection if it has been 10 years or more since their last tetanus-diphtheria vaccine. Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who are in close contact with a baby who is less than a year old and for adults who work in the healthcare field.

Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis are serious diseases that can cause life-threatening illnesses. Although some serious side effects can occur after a dose of Tdap (usually from the pertussis vaccine part), this rarely happens. The chance of your child catching one of these diseases, and being permanently injured or dying as a result, is much greater than the chance of your child getting a serious side effect from the Tdap vaccine.

This vaccine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Suspension

Before Using:
In deciding to use a vaccine, the risks of taking the vaccine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this vaccine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Adacel®  and  Boostrix®  are not used in children younger than 10 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended that teenagers be given a Tdap vaccine instead of the tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccine. The committee is also encouraging all teenagers, even those who have already received Td, to get a Tdap booster to help protect against pertussis (eg, whooping cough). If you have questions about whether your teenager should receive Tdap, contact your doctor.


Geriatric:
Adacel®  is not used in adults 65 years of age and older.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of  Boostrix®  in the elderly.

There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.

The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.

You or your child may receive other vaccines at the same time as this one, but in a different body area. You should receive patient instructions for all of the vaccines. Make sure you understand all of the information and talk to your doctor or nurse if you have questions.

It is important that you or your child receive all of the shots. Try to keep all scheduled appointments. Make another appointment as soon as possible if you or your child misses a dose of this vaccine.


Precautions:
It is very important that you call the doctor right away if you or your child have any unwanted effects after receiving the vaccine . This may include fainting, seizures, a high fever, crying that will not stop, or severe redness or swelling where the shot was given.

This vaccine may cause a serious type of allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, swelling of the tongue and throat, or trouble breathing after you get the injection.

Fainting may occur after you receive this vaccine. You may also have vision changes, numbness or tingling in your arms, hands, or feet, or jerky movements of the arms and legs. Call the doctor right away if you or your child have any of these symptoms.

It is very important to tell the doctor if you or your child are allergic to rubber. The tip caps of the prefilled syringes may contain dry natural latex rubber. This may cause an allergic reaction if you have a latex allergy.
