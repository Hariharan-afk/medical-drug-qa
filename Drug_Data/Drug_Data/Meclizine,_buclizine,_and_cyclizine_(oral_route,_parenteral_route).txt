This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet

Before Using:

Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
There is no specific information comparing use of buclizine, cyclizine, and meclizine in children with use in other age groups. However, children may be especially sensitive to the anticholinergic effects (e.g., dryness of mouth, nose, and throat) of these medicines.


Geriatric:
There is no specific information comparing use of buclizine, cyclizine, and meclizine in the elderly with use in other age groups. Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. However, older people may be especially sensitive to the anticholinergic effects (e.g., constipation; difficult urination; dryness of mouth, nose, and throat) of these medicines.


Pregnancy:
These medicines have not been shown to cause birth defects or other problems in humans. However, studies in animals have shown that buclizine, cyclizine, and meclizine given in doses many times the usual human dose cause birth defects, such as cleft palate.


Breastfeeding:
Although these medicines may pass into breast milk, they have not been reported to cause problems in nursing babies. However, since these medicines tend to decrease the secretions of the body, it is possible that the flow of breast milk may be reduced in some patients.
