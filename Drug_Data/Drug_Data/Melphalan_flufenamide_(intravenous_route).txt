Description:
Melphalan flufenamide injection is used in combination with dexamethasone to treat multiple myeloma (bone marrow cancer) in patients whose cancer has come back and who have received at least 4 previous treatments (eg, a CD38-directed monoclonal antibody, a proteasome inhibitor, and an immunomodulatory agent) that did not work well.

Melphalan flufenamide belongs to the group of medicines called alkylating agents (cancer medicines). It works by interfering with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor.
