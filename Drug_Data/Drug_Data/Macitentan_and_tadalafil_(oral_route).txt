Description:
Macitentan and tadalafil combination is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which is high blood pressure that occurs in the main artery that carries blood from the right side of the heart (the ventricle) to the lungs. When the smaller blood vessels in the lungs become more resistant to blood flow, the right ventricle must work harder to pump enough blood through the lungs. Macitentan and tadalafil combination works by relaxing these blood vessels and increasing the supply of blood to the lungs, which reduces the workload of the heart.

This medicine is only available for female patients under a restricted distribution program called the Macitentan-Containing Products REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program. Male patients do not need to enroll in the REMS program.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet

One of these forms of birth control should be combined with a condom, a diaphragm, or a cervical cap. If a partner’s vasectomy is the chosen method of contraception, a hormone or barrier method must be used along with this method.

Nitrate medicines include nitroglycerin, isosorbide, Imdur®, Nitro-Bid®, Nitrostat®, Nitro-Dur®, Transderm Nitro®, Nitrol® Ointment, and Nitrolingual® Spray. Some street drugs called "poppers" (eg, amyl nitrate, butyl nitrate, or nitrite) also contain nitrates. If you need to use a nitrate medicine, take it at least 48 hours after your last dose of tadalafil.

Do not have 4 or more alcohol-containing drinks in a short period of time while you are taking tadalafil. Alcohol can increase your chances of getting a headache or dizziness, increase your heart rate, or lower your blood pressure.
