Description:
Oxycodone and acetaminophen combination is used to relieve pain severe enough to require opioid treatment and when other pain medicines did not work well enough or cannot be tolerated.

Acetaminophen is used to relieve pain and reduce fever in patients. It does not become habit-forming when taken for a long time. But acetaminophen may cause other unwanted effects when taken in large doses, including liver damage. Although rare, use of acetaminophen has been reported to lead to liver transplantation and death, usually at high doses and when multiple acetaminophen-containing products have been used.

Oxycodone belongs to the group of medicines called opioid analgesics (pain medicines). It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain, and stops or prevents cough.

When oxycodone is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, under the close supervision of healthcare providers, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using opioids to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is less likely to occur when opioids are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal symptoms if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal symptoms can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.  Percocet®  and  Xartemis™  are available only under a restricted distribution program called the Opioid Analgesic REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet
-> Solution

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of oxycodone and acetaminophen combination in the pediatric population. Use of  Xartemis™  is not recommended in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of oxycodone and acetaminophen combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, heart, lung, or liver problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving this medicine.

It is very important that you understand the rules of the Opioid Analgesic REMS program to prevent addiction, abuse, and misuse of oxycodone and acetaminophen combination. This medicine should also come with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Read it again each time you refill your prescription in case there is new information. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

You may take this medicine with or without food.

Swallow the  extended-release tablet  whole with water. Do not crush, break, chew, dissolve, snort, or inject it. Do not pre-soak, lick, or wet the tablet before placing it in your mouth. Do not give this medicine by feeding tubes.

Check with your doctor first before changing dosage forms (eg, capsules, extended-release tablets, tablets). These forms are very different from each other.

This combination medicine contains acetaminophen (Tylenol®). Carefully check the labels of all other medicines you are using, because they may also contain acetaminophen. It is not safe to use more than 4 grams (4,000 milligrams) of acetaminophen in one day (24 hours). Patients with liver disease may have a lower daily maximum dose of acetaminophen.

Close follow-up with healthcare providers and creation of a pain management plan is an effective way to manage chronic pain. This plan may include limiting opioid medicines to the lowest effective dose for a limited period of time.

Oxycodone and acetaminophen combination can cause serious unwanted effects or fatal overdose if taken by children, pets, or adults who are not used to strong opioid pain medicines. Make sure you store the medicine in a safe and secure place to prevent others from getting it.

Drop off any unused opioid medicine at a drug take-back location right away. If you do not have a drug take-back location near you, flush any unused opioid medicine down the toilet. Check your local drug store and clinics for take-back locations. You can also check the DEA web site for locations. Here is the link to the FDA safe disposal of medicines website:www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/ensuringsafeuseofmedicine/safedisposalofmedicines/ucm186187.htm .


Precautions:
It is very important that your doctor check your progress while you are taking this medicine , especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of treatment. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to take it. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Do not use this medicine if you are using or have used an MAO inhibitor (eg, isocarboxazid [Marplan®], linezolid [Zyvox®], phenelzine [Nardil®], selegiline [Eldepryl®], tranylcypromine [Parnate®]) within the past 14 days.

It is against the law and dangerous for anyone else to use your medicine. Keep your unused medicine in a safe and secure place.

This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that can make you drowsy or less alert). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, other prescription pain medicine or opioids, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics (numbing medicines), including some dental anesthetics. Also, there may be a greater risk of liver damage if you drink three or more alcoholic beverages while you are taking acetaminophen. Do not drink alcoholic beverages, and check with your doctor before taking any of these medicines while you are using this medicine .

If you think you or someone else may have taken an overdose of this medicine, get emergency help at once . Your doctor may also give naloxone to treat an overdose. Naloxone is a medicine that temporarily reverses the effects of an overdose. If you have been prescribed naloxone, make sure household members know how to use this on you in the event of an overdose or suspected overdose. Emergency medical attention is still needed after naloxone is used because the reversal effects are only temporary. Signs of an overdose include : dark urine, difficult or trouble breathing, irregular, fast or slow, or shallow breathing, nausea or vomiting, pain in the upper stomach, pale or blue lips, fingernails, or skin, pinpoint pupils of the eyes, or yellow eyes or skin.

This medicine may be habit-forming. If you feel that the medicine is not working as well, do not use more than your prescribed dose. Call your doctor for instructions.

This medicine may cause sleep-related breathing problems (eg, sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoxemia). Your doctor may decrease your dose if you have sleep apnea (stop breathing for short periods during sleep) while using this medicine.

Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help lessen this problem. Also, lying down for a while may relieve the dizziness or lightheadedness.

This medicine may make you dizzy, drowsy, or lightheaded. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you .

Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, unusual tiredness or weakness, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.

Call your doctor right away if you have worsening of pain, increased sensitivity to pain, or new pain after taking this medicine. These may be symptoms of opioid-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia.

Serious skin reactions (eg, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) can occur with this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, chills, cough, diarrhea, itching, joint or muscle pain red irritated eyes, red skin lesions, often with a purple center, sore throat, sores, ulcers, or white spots in the mouth or on the lips, or unusual tiredness or weakness while you are using this medicine.

This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using this medicine.

Using opioids for a long time can cause severe constipation. To prevent this, your doctor may direct you to take laxatives, drink a lot of fluids, or increase the amount of fiber in your diet. Be sure to follow the directions carefully, because continuing constipation can lead to more serious problems.

Do not change your dose or suddenly stop using it without checking with your doctor . Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely. This may help prevent worsening of your condition and reduce the possibility of withdrawal symptoms, including stomach cramps, anxiety, fever, irritability, nausea, restlessness, runny nose, sweating, tremors, or trouble with sleeping.

Using this medicine while you are pregnant may cause neonatal withdrawal syndrome in your newborn baby. Tell your doctor right away if your child has an abnormal sleep pattern, diarrhea, a high-pitched cry, irritability, shakiness or tremors, sneezing, weight loss, vomiting, yawning, or failure to gain weight.

-> Your baby should generally nurse every 2 to 3 hours and should not sleep for more than 4 hours at a time.
-> Check with your doctor or hospital emergency room immediately if your baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, difficulty breathing, or limpness. These may be symptoms of an overdose and need immediate medical attention.
Before you have any medical tests, tell the medical doctor in charge that you are taking this medicine. The results of some tests may be affected by this medicine.

Check with your doctor right away if you have anxiety, restlessness, a fast heartbeat, fever, sweating, muscle spasms, twitching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or see or hear things that are not there. These may be symptoms of a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. Your risk may be higher if you also take certain other medicines that affect serotonin levels in your body.
