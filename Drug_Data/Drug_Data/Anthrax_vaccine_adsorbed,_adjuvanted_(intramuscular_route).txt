Description:
Anthrax vaccine adsorbed, adjuvanted is used to prevent infection caused by anthrax bacteria. It is used after exposure to anthrax, together with antibiotics, to protect people from getting the disease.

Anthrax is a serious disease that may cause death. It is spread by touching or eating something that is infected with the anthrax germ, such as animals, or by breathing in the anthrax germ.

This vaccine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.
