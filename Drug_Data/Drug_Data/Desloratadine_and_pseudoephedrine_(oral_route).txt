Description:
Desloratadine and pseudoephedrine is a combination of two medicines used to treat nasal congestion (stuffy nose), sneezing, and runny nose caused by hay fever.

Desloratadine works by preventing the effects of a substance called histamine, which is produced by the body. Histamine can cause itching, sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes.

The pseudoephedrine causes narrowing of blood vessels. This leads to clearing of nasal congestion, but it may also cause an increase in blood pressure in patients who have high blood pressure.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

Do not give any over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medicine to a baby or child under 4 years of age.  Using these medicines in very young children might cause serious or possibly life-threatening side effects .
