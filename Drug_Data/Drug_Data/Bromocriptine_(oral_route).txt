Description:
Bromocriptine belongs to the group of medicines known as ergot alkaloids. Bromocriptine blocks the release of a hormone called prolactin from the pituitary gland. Prolactin affects the menstrual cycle and milk production.

Bromocriptine is used to treat certain menstrual problems (eg, amenorrhea) in women and stops milk production in some men and women who have abnormal milk leakage. It is also used to treat infertility in both men and women that occurs because the body is making too much prolactin.

Bromocriptine is also used to treat acromegaly (overproduction of growth hormone) and pituitary prolactinomas (tumors of the pituitary gland).

Bromocriptine is also used to treat the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease, often in combination with levodopa.

Bromocriptine is also used together with proper diet and exercise to lower blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet
-> Capsule

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of bromocriptine to treat acromegaly, Parkinson's disease, and type 2 diabetes in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of bromocriptine in children 16 years of age and older with prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 16 years of age.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of bromocriptine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of this medicine than younger adults and are more likely to have confusion, hallucinations, or uncontrolled body movements, and age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving bromocriptine.


Breastfeeding:
Studies in women breastfeeding have demonstrated harmful infant effects. An alternative to this medication should be prescribed or you should stop breastfeeding while using this medicine.

Precautions:
It is important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits  to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

For females using Parlodel®  who are not trying to get pregnant:

-> Use an effective form of birth control (other than oral contraceptives) to keep from getting pregnant. A pregnancy test is needed every 4 weeks during the amenorrheic period or every time you miss a monthly period. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.
-> Check with your doctor right away if you develop blurred vision, a sudden headache, or severe nausea and vomiting.
Do not use Cycloset®  if you had recently given birth to a child (postpartum). This medicine may cause serious and life-threatening problems when given to postpartum women, including high blood pressure, heart attack, seizures, stroke, or mental illness.

This medicine may cause some people to become drowsy, dizzy, or less alert than they are normally. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous unless you know how this medicine affects you .

Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. These symptoms are more likely to occur when you begin taking this medicine or when the dose is increased.

Parlodel®  may increase your risk of having a condition called retroperitoneal fibrosis. This is more likely to occur if you are receiving this medicine on high doses and have been using it for a long time. Check with your doctor if you have continuing or severe stomach pain, increased frequency of urination, continuing loss of appetite, lower back pain, continuing or severe nausea and vomiting, or weakness while taking this medicine.

It is very important to follow carefully any instructions from your health care team about taking Cycloset® :

-> Counseling—Other family members need to learn how to prevent side effects or help with side effects if they occur. Also, patients with diabetes may need special counseling about diabetes medicine dosing changes that might occur because of lifestyle changes, such as changes in exercise and diet. Furthermore, counseling on contraception and pregnancy may be needed because of the problems that can occur in patients with diabetes during pregnancy.
-> Travel—Keep your recent prescription and your medical history with you. Be prepared for an emergency as you would normally. Make allowances for changing time zones and keep your meal times as close as possible to your usual meal times.
-> In case of emergency—There may be a time when you need emergency help for a problem caused by your diabetes. You need to be prepared for these emergencies. It is a good idea to wear a medical identification (ID) bracelet or neck chain at all times. Also, carry an ID card in your wallet or purse that says you have diabetes and a list of all of your medicines.
Too much Cycloset®  can cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) when it is used under certain conditions. Symptoms of low blood sugar must be treated before they lead to unconsciousness (passing out). People may feel different symptoms of low blood sugar . It is important that you learn which symptoms of low blood sugar you usually have so you can treat it quickly. Talk to your doctor about the best way to treat low blood sugar.

Symptoms of low blood sugar include  anxiety, behavior change similar to being drunk, blurred vision, cold sweats, confusion, cool, pale skin, difficulty in thinking, drowsiness, excessive hunger, fast heartbeat, headache (continuing), nausea, nervousness, nightmares, restless sleep, shakiness, slurred speech, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

If symptoms of low blood sugar occur, eat glucose tablets or gel, corn syrup, honey, or sugar cubes, or drink fruit juice, non-diet soft drink, or sugar dissolved in water. Also, check your blood for low blood sugar. Glucagon is used in emergency situations when severe symptoms such as seizures or unconsciousness occur. Have a glucagon kit available, along with a syringe or needle, and know how to use it. Members of your household also should know how to use it.

High blood sugar may occur  if you do not exercise as much as usual, have a fever or infection, do not take enough or skip a dose of your diabetes medicine, or overeat or do not follow your meal plan.

If symptoms of high blood sugar occur, check your sugar level and then call your doctor for instructions .

Bromocriptine may cause dryness of the mouth. For temporary relief, use sugarless candy or gum, melt bits of ice in your mouth, or use a saliva substitute. However, if dry mouth continues for more than 2 weeks, check with your medical doctor or dentist. Continuing dryness of the mouth may increase the chance of dental disease, including tooth decay, gum disease, and fungus infections.

It may take several weeks for bromocriptine to work. Do not stop taking this medicine or reduce the amount you are taking without first checking with your doctor . Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping completely. This will decrease your chance of having withdrawal symptoms including anxiety, depression, difficulty in breathing, fast heartbeat, high fever, high or low blood pressure, lack of feeling or emotion, loss of bladder control, seizures, severe muscle stiffness, sweating, trouble sleeping, unusually pale skin, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

Drinking alcohol while you are taking bromocriptine may cause you to have a certain reaction. Avoid alcoholic beverages until you have discussed this with your doctor. Some of the symptoms you may have if you drink any alcohol while you are taking this medicine are blurred vision, chest pain, confusion, fast or pounding heartbeat, flushing or redness of the face, nausea, severe weakness, sweating, throbbing headache, or vomiting.

Some people who have used this medicine had unusual changes in their behavior. Talk with your doctor right away if you start having unusual urges, such as gambling, compulsive shopping, or increased sex drive while using this medicine.

It is important that your doctor check you for melanoma (skin cancer) regularly if you have Parkinson's disease.
