Levothyroxine is also used together with surgery and radioiodine treatment to treat a type of thyroid cancer called thyroid-dependent well-differentiated thyroid cancer.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Capsule, Liquid Filled

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of levothyroxine in children. However, your child's doctor will check your child closely for heart problems during the first 2 weeks of treatment.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of levothyroxine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related heart or blood vessel problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving levothyroxine.


Breastfeeding:
Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.
