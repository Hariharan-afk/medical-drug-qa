Description:
Antihemophilic factor (AHF) recombinant porcine sequence injection is used to treat serious bleeding episodes in patients with acquired hemophilia A. The bleeding episode may be due to an injury or surgery. Antihemophilic factor recombinant porcine sequence is a manmade protein to replace the AHF produced naturally in the body to help form blood clots to stop bleeding.

Acquired Hemophilia A, also called classic hemophilia, is a condition that develops where the body does not make enough AHF. If you do not have enough AHF and you become injured, your blood will not form clots properly. You might bleed into and damage your muscles and joints. AHF injection is given to increase the levels of AHF in the blood.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
