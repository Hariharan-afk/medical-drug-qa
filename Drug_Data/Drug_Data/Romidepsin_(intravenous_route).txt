Description:
Romidepsin injection is used to treat a certain type of cancer of the white blood cells called cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in patients who have received at least 1 previous treatment.

Romidepsin interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected, other unwanted effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Before you begin treatment with romidepsin, you and your doctor should talk about the benefits of this medicine as well as the risks of receiving it.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
