Description:
Aclidinium is used as maintenance treatment in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a lung disease that also includes chronic bronchitis (swelling of the tubes leading to the lungs) or emphysema (damage to the air sacs in the lungs). This medicine will not relieve a COPD attack that has already started.

Aclidinium belongs to the family of medicines known as bronchodilators. These are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to help open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. They relieve cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Aerosol Powder
