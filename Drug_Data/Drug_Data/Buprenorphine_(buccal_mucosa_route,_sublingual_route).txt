Subutex


Description:
Buprenorphine  buccal film  is used to relieve pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and when other pain medicines did not work well enough or cannot be tolerated. This medicine is not used for minor pain or pain that only sometimes occurs. It should not be used to treat pain that you only have once in a while or "as needed". Buprenorphine acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain.

Buprenorphine  sublingual tablet  is used to treat opioid use disorder. When an opioid medicine is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if the opioid is stopped suddenly. Severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented when a person is switched to buprenorphine. It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to help prevent withdrawal side effects.

When buprenorphine  buccal film  is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using opioids to relieve their pain. Mental dependence is not likely to occur when opioids are used for this purpose under the close supervision of medical providers. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.

Subutex®  is available only with your healthcare provider's prescription.  Belbuca®  is available only under a restricted distribution program called the Opioid Analgesic REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Film

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.

Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of buprenorphine in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of buprenorphine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, heart or lung problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving buprenorphine in order to avoid potentially serious side effects.
