Fluconazole injection is used to treat serious fungal or yeast infections, including oropharyngeal candidiasis (thrush, oral thrush), esophageal candidiasis (candida esophagitis), other candida infections (including urinary tract infections, peritonitis [inflammation of the lining of the stomach], and infections that may occur in different parts of the body), or fungal (cryptococcal) meningitis. It is also used in children on life support called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This medicine works by killing the fungus or yeast, or preventing its growth.

Fluconazole injection is also used to prevent candidiasis in patients having bone marrow transplants, who receive cancer or radiation treatment.

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fluconazole injection for the  treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis  in children 6 months to 13 years of age, for the  treatment of esophageal candidiasis, other candida infections, or fungal (cryptococcal) meningitis  in children, and for  children on ECMO . Safety and efficacy have been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fluconazole injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving fluconazole injection.
