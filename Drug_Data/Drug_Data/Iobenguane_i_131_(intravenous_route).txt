Description:
Iobenguane I 131 injection is a radiopharmaceutical. Radiopharmaceuticals are radioactive agents that may be used to find and treat certain diseases or to study the function of the body's organs.

Iobenguane I 131 injection is used to treat iobenguane scan positive, advanced or metastatic (cancer that has spread) pheochromocytoma (cancer of the adrenal glands) or paraganglioma in patients who cannot be treated by surgery and who require systemic cancer treatment.

When very small doses of radioiodinated iobenguane are given, the radioactivity taken up by the adrenal glands helps find the tumors. An image of the gland on film or on a computer screen can be provided to help with the diagnosis.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor with specialized training in nuclear medicine or radiation oncology.
