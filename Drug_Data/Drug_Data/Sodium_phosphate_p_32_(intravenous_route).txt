Description:
Sodium phosphate P 32 is a radiopharmaceutical. Radiopharmaceuticals are radioactive agents that may be used to treat certain diseases or to study the activity of the body's organs.

Sodium phosphate P 32 is used to treat certain kinds of cancer. In this case, the radioactive agent builds up in the cancerous area and destroys the affected tissue. This radiopharmaceutical may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.

Sodium phosphate P 32 is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor with specialized training in nuclear medicine.


Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Studies on this medicine have been done only in adult patients, and there is no specific information about its use in children. However, children are especially sensitive to the effects of radiation. This may increase the chance of side effects during and after treatment.


Geriatric:
Older adults are especially sensitive to the effects of radiation. This may increase the chance of side effects during and after treatment.


Breastfeeding:
There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.


Drug Interactions:
Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.


Other Interactions:
Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.  Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.  Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.


Other Medical Problems:
The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of sodium phosphate P 32. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems.


Proper Use:
Your doctor may have special instructions for you in preparation for your treatment. If you do not understand them or if you have not received such instructions, check with your doctor in advance.

Dosing—The doses of radiopharmaceuticals will be different for different patients and for the different types of treatments. The amount of radioactivity of a radiopharmaceutical is expressed in units called becquerels or curies. Usual adult doses of sodium phosphate P 32 range from 37 megabecquerels (1 millicurie) to 185 megabecquerels (5 millicuries). The dose you receive depends on your size, age, and blood test measurements (blood counts). The amount of radiation received by the body to treat a disease is many times higher than from any diagnostic test, such as x-rays and nuclear medicine scans. Repeated doses may be necessary, depending on the kind of disease you have and how your body is responding to treatment.


Dosing:
The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.

The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.


Side Effects:
Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. When sodium phosphate P 32 is used at recommended doses, side effects usually are rare. However, blood problems, such as anemia or a decrease in the number of white blood cells, may occur in some patients.

Also, the following side effects may occur in patients with bone cancer receiving sodium phosphate P 32 for the relief of bone pain:


More common:
-> Diarrhea, fever, nausea, vomiting
Other side effects not listed may also occur in some patients. If you notice any other effects, check with your healthcare professional.

Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.
