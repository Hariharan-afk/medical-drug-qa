Description:
Avapritinib is used to treat a certain type of stomach, bowel, or esophagus cancer called gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) that cannot be treated with surgery or that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic), and that is caused by a certain platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) gene mutation.

This medicine is also used to treat advanced systemic mastocytosis (AdvSM), including aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis with associated hematological neoplasm (SM-AHN), and mast cell leukemia (MCL). It is also used to treat indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM).

Avapritinib belongs to the group of medicines known as antineoplastics. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by sunitinib, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, like hair loss, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects may not occur for months or years after the medicine is used.

Before you begin treatment with avapritinib, you should talk to your doctor about the benefits as well as the risks of using this medicine.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
