Description:
Note:  Women of childbearing potential should not use or handle this medicine . Dutasteride can cause birth defects in male fetuses.

Dutasteride and tamsulosin combination is used to treat men who have symptoms of an enlarged prostate gland, which is also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Benign enlargement of the prostate is a problem that can occur in men as they get older. The prostate gland is located below the bladder. When the prostate gland gets larger, certain muscles in the gland get in the way of the tube that drains urine from the bladder. This can cause problems with urinating, such as a need to urinate often, a weak stream when urinating, or a feeling of not being able to empty the bladder completely.

Dutasteride blocks the action of an enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase. This enzyme changes testosterone to another hormone that causes the prostate gland to grow. Dutasteride will cause the size of the prostate to decrease, but the effect lasts only as long as the medicine is taken. If it is stopped, the prostate begins to grow again.

Tamsulosin helps relax the muscles in the prostate gland and the opening of the bladder. This may help increase the flow of urine or decrease symptoms.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
