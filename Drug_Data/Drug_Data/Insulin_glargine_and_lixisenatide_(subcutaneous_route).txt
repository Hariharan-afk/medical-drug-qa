Description:
Insulin glargine and lixisenatide combination is used to treat a type of diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes) called type 2 diabetes.

Insulin glargine is a long-acting type of insulin that works slowly, over about 24 hours. Insulin is one of many hormones that help the body turn the food we eat into energy. This is done by using the glucose (sugar) in the blood as quick energy. Also, insulin helps us store energy that we can use later. When you have diabetes mellitus, your body cannot make enough insulin or does not use insulin properly. This causes you to have too much sugar in your blood. Like other types of insulin, insulin glargine is used to keep your blood sugar level close to normal. Lixisenatide is to be used when diet and exercise do not result in good blood sugar control.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
