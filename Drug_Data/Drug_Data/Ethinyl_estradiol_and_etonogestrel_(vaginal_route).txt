Description:
Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol combination is used to prevent pregnancy. It is a flexible birth control vaginal ring that contains two types of hormones, etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol. It works by stopping a woman's egg from fully developing each month. The egg can no longer accept a sperm and fertilization (pregnancy) is prevented.

No contraceptive method is 100 percent effective. Birth control methods such as having surgery to become sterile or not having sex are more effective than vaginal rings. Discuss your options for birth control with your doctor.

This medicine will not prevent HIV infection or other sexually transmitted diseases. It will not help as emergency contraception, such as after unprotected sexual contact.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Insert, Extended Release

Proper Use:
Use this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor . Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may cause unwanted side effects.

This medicine is to be used  only in the vagina . This combination medicine is contained in a ring that is placed into your vagina. The ring will slowly release small amounts of the medicine for your body to absorb.

This medicine comes with a patient information leaflet and patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.

NuvaRing® is used in a 4 week cycle. You may start using the vaginal ring on the first day of your menstrual period or between the second and fifth day, keeping it in place for 3 weeks.

Once the ring is in place inside your vagina, you should not be able to feel it. If you feel uncomfortable, the ring may not be inserted far enough. Gently push the ring farther into your vagina. If you feel pain, talk to your doctor.

Check for the presence of the ring inside your vagina regularly (including before and after having sex).

The ring may move down into the lower part of your vagina accidently. This can happen if you strain to have a bowel movement. Use your finger to gently push the ring back into place. If the ring comes all the way out of your vagina, rinse it off with warm water and put it back in. Call your doctor if the ring comes out several times.

Remove the vaginal ring after 3 weeks on the same day of the week and time it was inserted. During the 1-week break, you will usually have your menstrual period. Another ring will be inserted after a week.

While using this medicine, you may need to use an additional form of birth control method (eg, condom, spermicide) during the first 7 days to prevent pregnancy. Do not use a vaginal diaphragm because the ring may affect how the diaphragm fits.

If you need to remove the ring, hook your finger through it and pull it out.

If you are switching from a combination hormonal method (eg, pills, patch) to NuvaRing® , start using this medicine on any day. Do not start using this medicine any later than the day you would start your next birth control pill or patch.

If you are switching from a progestin-only method (eg, progestin-only pill, implant, injection, intrauterine system) to NuvaRing® , start using it on the day after you used your last progestin-only pill, or on the day your implant or IUD is removed, or on the day you would have your next injection. You must also use an additional barrier method of birth control (eg, male condom with spermicide) for the first 7 days.

Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you are using this medicine. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice may change the amount of this medicine that is absorbed in the body.
