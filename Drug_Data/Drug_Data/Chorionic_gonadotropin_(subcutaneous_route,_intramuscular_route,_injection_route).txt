CanadianBrand Name:
Chorionic Gonadotropin


Description:
Chorionic gonadotropin injection is a hormone used as a fertility medicine to develop eggs in women who have not been able to become pregnant because of problems in ovulation. It is also used to help men with low sperm counts produce more sperms and used when testicles have not dropped down in the scrotum which is caused by a pituitary gland problem.

Chorionic gonadotropin is a drug whose actions are almost the same as those of luteinizing hormone (LH), which is produced by the pituitary gland. It is a hormone also normally produced by the placenta in pregnancy. Chorionic gonadotropin has different uses for females and males.

In females, chorionic gonadotropin is used to help conception occur. It is usually given in combination with other drugs such as menotropins and urofollitropin. Many women being treated with these drugs usually have already tried clomiphene alone and have not been able to conceive yet. Chorionic gonadotropin is also used in in-vitro fertilization (IVF) programs.

In males, LH and chorionic gonadotropin stimulate the testes to produce male hormones such as testosterone. Testosterone causes the enlargement of the penis and testes and the growth of pubic and underarm hair. It also increases the production of sperm.

Although chorionic gonadotropin has been prescribed to help some patients lose weight, it should never be used this way. When used improperly, chorionic gonadotropin can cause serious problems.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Powder for Solution

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of chorionic gonadotropin injection in children. However, children are more likely to develop early puberty, which may require caution or adjustments in the dose in patients receiving this medicine.

Chorionic gonadotropin, when used for treating cryptorchidism (a birth defect where the testes remain inside the body), has caused the sexual organs of some male children to develop too rapidly.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of chorionic gonadotropin injection in the elderly.


Breastfeeding:
There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.


Drug Interactions:
Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.


Other Interactions:
Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.

Precautions:
It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits  to make sure that the medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects. Blood and urine tests, semen testing, and ultrasound examinations are needed to check for any unwanted effects caused by this medicine.

This medicine may cause serious allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor right away if you have chest tightness, cough, difficulty swallowing, dizziness, hives, itching, skin rash, puffiness or swelling of the eyelids or around the eyes, face, lips, or tongue, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

This medicine may cause ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), which can be life-threatening. Check with your doctor right away if you have bloating, diarrhea, severe nausea, stomach pain, rapid weight gain, or vomiting.

This medicine may cause serious lung problems (eg, atelectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or asthma). Check with your doctor right away if you have blue lips, fingernails, or skin, chest tightness, coughing, difficulty or fast breathing, fever, rapid heartbeat, or trouble breathing.

This medicine may increase your risk of having a blood clot, heart attack, or stroke. This is more likely in people who already have heart disease. Contact your doctor right away if you have chest pain or tightness, a fast or irregular heartbeat, unusual flushing or warmth of the skin, increased coughing, trouble with breathing, a sudden difficulty with breathing at night, or abnormal swelling in your ankles or legs. These could be symptoms of serious heart problems or blood clots.

This medicine may cause more than one egg to be released from your ovary at the same time. This means you may become pregnant with more than one baby. Talk with your doctor about this possibility before you start using this medicine.

This medicine may increase your risk of having ovarian cancer if you received it more than one time to get pregnant. Talk to your doctor about this risk.
