Description:
Pertuzumab injection is used to treat breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. It is used together with other cancer medicines (eg, docetaxel, trastuzumab) to treat patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. The HER2 protein is produced by some breast tumors. Pertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that interferes with the growth of this protein, which is eventually destroyed by the body.

Pertuzumab is also used as part of a complete treatment regimen for early breast cancer before surgery and as an additional treatment for breast cancer that is at high risk for occurring again.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
