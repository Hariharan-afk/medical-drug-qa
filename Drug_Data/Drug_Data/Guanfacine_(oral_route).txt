Description:
Guanfacine is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.

Guanfacine works by controlling the nerve impulses along certain nerve pathways. As a result, it relaxes the blood vessels so that blood passes through them more easily. This helps to lower blood pressure.

Guanfacine  extended-release tablets  are also used alone or together with other medicines to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and teenagers. It works in the treatment of ADHD by increasing attention and decreasing restlessness in children and adults who are overactive, cannot concentrate for very long, or are easily distracted and impulsive. This medicine is used as part of a total treatment program that also includes social, educational, and psychological treatment.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you . Also, standing up slowly when getting up from a lying or sitting position may also help.

This medicine may worsen heart rhythm problems (eg, sinus node dysfunction, atrioventricular block), especially in patients who are taking other medicines. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns.

Continuing dryness of the mouth may increase the chance of dental disease, including tooth decay, gum disease, and fungus infections.
