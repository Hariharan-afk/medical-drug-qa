Description:
Hydrocodone and chlorpheniramine polistirex combination is used to treat cough and respiratory symptoms associated with a cold or allergy.

Hydrocodone polistirex is an opioid cough suppressant. It acts directly on the cough center in the brain to prevent a cough. Chlorpheniramine polistirex is an antihistamine that treats or prevents the symptoms of an allergy.

When hydrocodone polistirex is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming. This could cause mental or physical dependence. Physical dependence may lead to unwanted withdrawal effects if hydrocodone is stopped suddenly. Talk to your doctor if you have questions.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Suspension, Extended Release

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.

Pediatric:
Because of the toxicity of hydrocodone polistirex, use in children younger than 6 years of age is not recommended. Hydrocodone has caused serious breathing problems in young children, sometimes causing death. Hydrocodone and chlorpheniramine polistirex combination is not indicated for use in children younger than 18 years of age.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of hydrocodone and chlorpheniramine polistirex combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to develop age-related heart, kidney, liver, or lung problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving this medicine.

Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using this medicine.

This medicine may make you drowsy. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you .

This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that can make you drowsy or less alert). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, other prescription pain medicine or opioids, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics.

If you think you or someone else may have taken an overdose of this medicine, get emergency help at once . Your doctor may also give naloxone to treat an overdose. Naloxone is a medicine that temporarily reverses the effects of an overdose. If you have been prescribed naloxone, make sure household members know how to use this on you in the event of an overdose or suspected overdose. Emergency medical attention is still needed after naloxone is used because the reversal effects are only temporary. Signs of an overdose include : pale or blue lips, fingernails, or skin, confusion, difficult or troubled breathing, irregular, fast or slow, or shallow breathing, extreme sleepiness or drowsiness, cold and clammy skin, or lightheadedness or fainting.

Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help lessen this problem. Also, lying down for a while may relieve the dizziness or lightheadedness.

Do not change your dose or suddenly stop using this medicine without first checking with your doctor . Your doctor may want you or your child to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely. This may help prevent worsening of your condition and reduce the possibility of withdrawal symptoms, including stomach cramps, anxiety, fever, nausea, runny nose, sweating, tremors, or trouble with sleeping.

Using too much of this medicine may cause infertility (unable to have children). Talk with your doctor before using this medicine if you plan to have children.

Check with your doctor right away if you have anxiety, restlessness, a fast heartbeat, fever, sweating, muscle spasms, twitching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or see or hear things that are not there.
