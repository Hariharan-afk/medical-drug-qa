Solarcaine Lidocaine First Aid Spray


Description:
Lidocaine  topical jelly or ointment  is used on different parts of the body to cause numbness or loss of feeling for patients having certain medical procedures. It is also used to relieve pain and itching caused by conditions such as sunburn or other minor burns, insect bites or stings, poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, minor cuts, or scratches.  Xylocaine® jelly  is used to treat painful urethritis (inflammation of the urethra). It is also used to prevent and control pain in procedures involving the male and female urethra.  Xylocaine® jelly  is also used to lubricate the nose, mouth, and throat for intubation.

Lidocaine  viscous topical solution  is also used to treat sore mouth or throat and also reduce gagging during the taking of X-ray pictures and dental impressions.

Lidocaine  skin patch  is used to relieve nerve pain caused by herpes zoster or shingles (postherpetic neuralgia).

Lidocaine belongs to the family of medicines called local anesthetics. This medicine prevents pain by blocking the signals at the nerve endings in the skin. This medicine does not cause unconsciousness as general anesthetics do when used for surgery.
