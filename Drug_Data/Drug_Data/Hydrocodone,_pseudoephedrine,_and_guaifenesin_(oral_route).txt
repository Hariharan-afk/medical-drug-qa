Hycofenix


Description:
Hydrocodone, pseudoephedrine, and guaifenesin combination is used to relieve cough and nasal congestion (stuffy nose) caused by the common cold.

Hydrocodone is an opioid cough suppressant. It acts directly on the cough center in the brain to relieve cough. Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant, which decreases nasal congestion by narrowing the blood vessels and reducing blood flow to the nasal passage. Guaifenesin is used to help clear mucus or phlegm from the chest when you have congestion from a cold or flu. It works by thinning the mucus or phlegm in the lungs.

When hydrocodone is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming. This could cause mental or physical dependence. Physical dependence may lead to unwanted withdrawal effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. Talk to your doctor if you have questions.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.


Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
The use of hydrocodone in children younger than 6 years of age has caused serious breathing problems, sometimes causing death. Use of hydrocodone, pseudoephedrine, and guaifenesin combination is not indicated in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of hydrocodone, pseudoephedrine, and guaifenesin combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving this medicine. Due to side effects associated with this medicine, it should be used with additional caution in older adults.

Emergency medical attention is still needed after naloxone is used because the reversal effects are only temporary.
