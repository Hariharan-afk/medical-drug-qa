Description:
Rilpivirine is used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This medicine is usually given to patients who have not received any HIV treatment in the past. Rilpivirine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor.

Rilpivirine is also used together with cabotegravir for short-term treatment of HIV infection in patients when their healthcare provider determines that they meet certain requirements. It is used to assess how well you tolerate rilpivirine before receiving cabotegravir/rilpivirine combination injection (Cabenuva) or in patients who will miss a planned injection of Cabenuva.

This medicine will not cure HIV infection or AIDS. It works by lowering the amount of HIV in the blood and helps the immune system. This may help delay problems that result from AIDS or HIV disease. People who receive this medicine may continue to have some of the problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
