Description:
Selexipag injection is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which is the high blood pressure that occurs in the main artery that carries blood from the right side of the heart (the ventricle) to the lungs. When the smaller blood vessels in the lungs become more resistant to blood flow, the right ventricle must work harder to pump enough blood through the lungs. It works by relaxing these blood vessels and increasing the supply of blood to the lungs, which reduces the workload of the heart. This medicine helps slow down the worsening of your disease and lowers your risk of being hospitalized for PAH.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Powder for Solution
