Description:
Fulvestrant injection is used to treat hormone-receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women who have not been previously treated with other medicines. It is also used to treat HR positive breast cancer that has progressed or worsened after hormonal therapy.

Fulvestrant injection is also used together with ribociclib to treat HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women who have not been previously treated with other medicines or whose cancer has progressed or worsened after hormonal therapy.

Fulvestrant injection is also used in combination with palbociclib or abemaciclib to treat HR positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic (cancer that has spread) breast cancer in women who have received hormonal therapy.

Many of the breast cancer tumors will grow when estrogen is available in the body. This medicine blocks the effects of estrogen in the body. As a result, the amount of estrogen that the tumor is exposed to, is reduced, which will limit the growth of the tumor.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
