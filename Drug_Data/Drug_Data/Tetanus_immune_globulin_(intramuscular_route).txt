Description:
Tetanus immune globulin is used to prevent tetanus infection (also known as lockjaw). Tetanus is a serious illness that causes convulsions (seizures) and severe muscle spasms that can be strong enough to cause bone fractures of the spine. Tetanus causes death in 30 to 40 percent of cases.

In recent years, two thirds of all tetanus cases have been in persons 50 years of age and older. A tetanus infection in the past does not make you immune to tetanus in the future.

Tetanus immune globulin works by giving your body the antibodies it needs to protect it against tetanus infection. This is called passive protection. This passive protection lasts long enough to protect your body until your body can produce its own antibodies against tetanus.

Tetanus immune globulin is to be administered only by or under the supervision of your doctor or other health care professional.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Solution

Although there is no specific information comparing use of tetanus immune globulin in children with use in other age groups, this medicine is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in children than it does in adults.


Geriatric:

Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people.
