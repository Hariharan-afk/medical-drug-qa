Description:
Gadobutrol injection is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent that is used to help create a clear picture of the body during an MRI scan. MRI scans are a special kind of procedure that lets a doctor look at the inside of the body, such as the brain. They use magnets and computers to create images or “pictures” of the body. Unlike x-rays, MRI scans do not involve radiation. Gadobutrol is a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) that is given by injection before the MRI to help diagnose problems in the brain, spine, breast, and other parts of your body.

Gadobutrol injection is also used for magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to evaluate known or suspected supra-aortic or renal artery disease in adults and children. It is also used to  assess how well blood flows through your heart (myocardial perfusion) and late gadolinium enhancement in adult patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.
