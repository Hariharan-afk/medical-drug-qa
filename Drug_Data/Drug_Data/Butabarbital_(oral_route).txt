Description:
Butabarbital is used to treat insomnia (trouble sleeping). It is also used before a surgical procedure to make a person sleep (be unconscious).

When used to treat insomnia, butabarbital will help you get to sleep faster and sleep throughout the night. In most cases, sleep medicines should only be used for short periods of time, such as 1 or 2 days, and for no longer than 1 or 2 weeks.
