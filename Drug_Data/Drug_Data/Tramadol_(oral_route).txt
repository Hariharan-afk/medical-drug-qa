Description:
Tramadol is used to relieve moderate to moderately severe pain, including pain after surgery. It is also used to treat pain severe enough to require opioid treatment and when other pain medicines did not work well enough or cannot be tolerated. The  extended-release capsules  or  tablets  are used for chronic ongoing pain.

Tramadol belongs to the group of medicines called opioid analgesics. It acts in the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain.

When tramadol is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.

This medicine is available only under a restricted distribution program called the Opioid Analgesic REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Capsule, Extended Release
-> Solution
-> Tablet
-> Tablet, Extended Release, 24 HR
-> Tablet, Extended Release
-> Capsule, Extended Release, 24 HR
-> Suspension

Before Using:

Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines.

Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of  Ryzolt™  in children younger than 16 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

Conzip® extended-release capsules ,  Qdolo® oral liquid , and  Ultram® tablets  should not be used in children younger than 12 years of age.  It should not be used to relieve pain after surgery removal of tonsils or adenoids in any children.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of  tramadol extended-release tablets  in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of tramadol in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted side effects (eg, constipation, lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting, stomach upset, weakness) and age-related liver, kidney, heart, or lung problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving tramadol.

Precautions:
It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits , especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of treatment to make sure the medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Do not use this medicine if you are using or have used an MAO inhibitor (MAOI) such as isocarboxazid [Marplan®], linezolid [Zyvox®], phenelzine [Nardil®], selegiline [Eldepryl®], tranylcypromine [Parnate®]) within the past 14 days.

You should not take other medicines that also contain tramadol. This includes Conzip®, Qdolo®, Ryzolt™, Ultram®, or Ultracet®. Using these medicines together may increase your chance for more serious side effects .

Check with your doctor before using this medicine with alcohol or other medicines that affect the central nervous system (CNS) . The use of alcohol or other medicines that affect the CNS with tramadol may worsen the side effects of this medicine, such as dizziness, poor concentration, drowsiness, unusual dreams, and trouble with sleeping. Some examples of medicines that affect the CNS are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicines, medicine for depression, medicine for anxiety, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics.

This medicine may cause sleep-related breathing problems (eg, sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoxemia). Your doctor may decrease your dose if you have sleep apnea (stop breathing for short periods during sleep) while using this medicine.

Using this medicine while you are pregnant may cause neonatal withdrawal syndrome in your newborn baby. Check with your doctor right away if your baby has an abnormal sleep pattern, diarrhea, a high-pitched cry, irritability, shakiness or tremors, weight loss, vomiting, or fails to gain weight. Tell your doctor right away if you think you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant while using this medicine.

Tramadol is highly metabolized in the body. Some people change tramadol to a stronger product (O-desmethyltramadol ) more quickly than others. These individuals are called "ultra-rapid metabolizers of tramadol". Contact your doctor immediately if you experience extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing . These symptoms may indicate that you are an "ultra-rapid metabolizer of tramadol." As a result, there is too much O-desmethyltramadol  in the body and more side effects of O-desmethyltramadol  than usual. Children may be especially sensitive to this effect (eg, serious breathing problems, death). Do not give this medicine to:

-> Children younger than 12 years of age.
-> Children younger than 18 years of age who have had surgery removal of tonsils or adenoids.
-> Children 12 to 18 years of age who have a high risk for breathing problems (eg, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, lung disease).
If a nursing mother is an ultra-rapid metabolizer of tramadol, it could lead to an overdose in the nursing baby and cause very serious side effects.

For nursing mothers using this medicine :

-> Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about taking tramadol or about how this medicine may affect your baby.
-> Call your doctor if you become extremely tired and have difficulty caring for your baby.
-> Your baby should generally nurse every 2 to 3 hours and should not sleep more than 4 hours at a time.
-> Check with your doctor, hospital emergency room, or local emergency services (eg, "call 9-1-1") immediately if your baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, difficulty breathing, or limpness. These may be symptoms of an overdose and need immediate medical attention.
Call your doctor right away if you have worsening of pain, increased sensitivity to pain, or new pain after taking this medicine. These may be symptoms of opioid-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia.

Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have anxiety, restlessness, a fast heartbeat, fever, sweating, muscle spasms, twitching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or see or hear things that are not there. These may be symptoms of a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. Your risk may be higher if you also take certain other medicines that affect serotonin levels in your body.

Let your doctor know if you or anyone in your family has bipolar disorder (manic-depressive disorder) or has tried to attempt suicide.

This medicine may cause hyponatremia (low sodium levels in the blood). Check with your doctor right away if you have coma, confusion, decreased urine output, dizziness, fast or irregular heartbeat, headache, increased thirst, muscle pain or cramps, nausea or vomiting, swelling of the face, ankles, or hands, trouble breathing, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

Before having any kind of surgery (including dental surgery) or emergency treatment, tell the doctor or dentist in charge that you are taking this medicine. Serious side effects can occur if your doctor or dentist gives you certain medicines without knowing that you have been taking tramadol.

If you think you or someone else may have taken an overdose of this medicine, get emergency help at once . Your doctor may also give naloxone and other medicines to treat an overdose. Signs of an overdose include : seizures, difficulty or trouble breathing, irregular, fast or slow, or shallow breathing, pale or blue lips, fingernails, or skin, pinpoint pupils of the eyes.

Do not change your dose or suddenly stop using this medicine without first checking with your doctor . Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely. This may help prevent worsening of your condition and reduce the possibility of withdrawal symptoms, including stomach cramps, anxiety, fever, nausea, runny nose, sweating, tremors, or trouble sleeping.
