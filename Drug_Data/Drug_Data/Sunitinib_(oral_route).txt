Description:
Sunitinib is used to treat a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after other medicines (eg, imatinib) did not work very well. It may also be used when patients are not able to take imatinib. GIST is a group of cancer cells that start growing in the wall of the stomach, bowels, or rectum. Sunitinib is also used to treat advanced (late-stage) kidney cancer and as additional treatment in patients at high risk for kidney cancer after surgical removal of the kidney.

Sunitinib is also used to treat a type of pancreatic cancer called pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET), that cannot be surgically removed and is locally advanced or metastatic (cancer that has spread).

Sunitinib belongs to the group of medicines known as antineoplastics. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by sunitinib, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, like hair loss, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects may not occur for months or years after the medicine is used.

Before you begin treatment with sunitinib, you should talk to your doctor about the benefits as well as the risks of using this medicine.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
