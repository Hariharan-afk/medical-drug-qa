Precautions:
It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress  while you are receiving this medicine, to see if the medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for any unwanted effects.

If your or your child's symptoms do not improve within a few days or if they become worse, check with your doctor.

Linezolid can lower the number of white blood cells in your blood temporarily, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions your doctor may ask you to take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

-> If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you or your child are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
-> Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
This medicine may cause diarrhea, and in some cases it can be severe. It may occur 2 months or more after you stop using this medicine. Do not take any medicine to treat diarrhea without first checking with your doctor. If you have any questions or if mild diarrhea continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.

You or your child may develop low blood sugar while using this medicine. You may feel weak, drowsy, confused, anxious, or very hungry. You may have trouble seeing or have a headache that won't go away. Ask your doctor what you should do if this happens. Some things that can lead to low blood sugar are exercising more than normal or waiting too long to eat.

This medicine may cause a serious reaction called lactic acidosis (build-up of acid in the blood). Call your doctor right away if you or your child feel very tired, weak, or nauseated, if you vomit or have trouble breathing, or if you feel lightheaded or fainting.

This medicine may cause serious condition called serotonin syndrome when taken with certain medicines, including medicines to treat depression (SSRIs) or opioid pain medicines. Check with your doctor first before taking any other medicines. Call your doctor right away if you or your child experience agitation, confusion, diarrhea, fever, overactive reflexes, poor coordination, restlessness, shivering, sweating, or trembling or shaking.

Check with your doctor right away if blurred vision, difficulty in reading, or any other change in vision occurs during treatment with this medicine. Your eyes may need to be checked by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor).

This medicine may cause rhabdomyolysis (severe muscle problem). Check with your doctor right away if you have dark-colored urine, fever, muscle cramps, spasms, pain, or stiffness, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

When taken with certain foods or drinks, linezolid can cause an increase in blood pressure. To avoid this, do not eat large amounts of foods or drink beverages that have a high tyramine content (most common in foods that are aged, fermented, pickled, or smoked to increase their flavor, including aged cheeses, air-dried, fermented, or smoked fish, meat, or poultry, sauerkraut, soy sauce, red wine, or tap beer). If a list of these foods and beverages is not given to you, ask your doctor to provide one.

Check with your doctor right away if you have agitation, coma, confusion, decreased urine output, depression, dizziness, headache, hostility, increased thirst, irritability, lethargy, muscle pain or cramps, muscle twitching, nausea or vomiting, rapid weight gain, seizures, stupor, swelling of the face, ankles, or hands, or unusual tiredness or weakness. These may be symptoms of hyponatremia (low sodium levels in the blood) or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).
