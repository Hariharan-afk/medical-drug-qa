Description:
Levalbuterol is used to prevent or treat bronchospasm in patients with asthma and other lung diseases.

Levalbuterol belongs to the family of medicines known as adrenergic bronchodilators. Adrenergic bronchodilators are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. They relieve cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of levalbuterol  solution  and  solution concentrate  in children younger than 6 years of age, and levalbuterol  aerosol  in children younger than 4 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established in these age groups.


Geriatric:

The levalbuterol  inhalation solution  and  inhalation solution concentrate  should be used with a jet nebulizer that is connected to an air compressor with good air flow. The inhalation solution and nebulizer will come with patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

To use the  inhalation solution or solution concentrate in the nebulizer :

-> Open the pouch and remove one vial.
-> Check the liquid in the vial. It should be clear or colorless. Do not use it if is discolored.
-> Open the vial and place the inhalation solution in the medicine reservoir or nebulizer cup on the machine. If you are using the solution concentrate, mix it first with sterile normal saline before placing it on the reservoir.
-> Connect the nebulizer to the face mask or mouthpiece.
-> Use the face mask or mouthpiece to breathe in the medicine.
-> Use the nebulizer for about 5 to 15 minutes, or until the medicine in the nebulizer cup is gone.
-> Clean all the parts of the nebulizer after each use.
-> Do not use if solution becomes cloudy.
-> Do not mix another inhalation medicine with levalbuterol in the nebulizer, unless told to do so by your doctor.
For patients using  levalbuterol inhalation aerosol :

-> The levalbuterol aerosol canister provides about 200 inhalations, depending on the size of the canister your doctor ordered. You should try to keep a record of the number of inhalations you use so you will know when the canister is almost empty. This canister, unlike some other aerosol canisters, cannot be floated in water to test its fullness.
-> When you use the inhaler for the first time, or if you have not used it in a while, the inhaler may not deliver the right amount of medicine with the first puff. Test or prime the inhaler before using it.
-> Shake the inhaler well immediately before each use.
-> Take the cap off the actuator (or mouthpiece). Inspect the actuator for the presence of foreign objects and make sure that the canister is seated in the actuator before each use.
-> Prime the inhaler by releasing 4 test sprays in the air, away from your face. The inhaler will now be ready to provide the right amount of medicine when you use it.
-> Breathe out fully through your mouth, expelling as much air from your lungs as possible. Place the mouthpiece fully into your mouth, holding the inhaler in the mouthpiece-down position and closing your lips around it.
-> While breathing in deeply and slowly through your mouth, fully depress the top of the metal canister with your middle finger. Immediately after the puff is delivered, release your finger from the canister and remove the inhaler from your mouth.
-> Hold your breath for 10 seconds, if possible.
-> If your doctor has prescribed more than a single inhalation/puff, wait 1 minute between inhalations. Then, shake the inhaler well and repeat.
-> Replace the cap on the mouthpiece after each use.
-> Clean the actuator or mouthpiece at least once a week.
-> Wash the actuator through the top and bottom with warm running water for 30 seconds at least once a week.
