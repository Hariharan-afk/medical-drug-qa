Description:
Urofollitropin injection is used to treat infertility in women. This medicine is a man-made hormone called follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). FSH is produced in the body by the pituitary gland. FSH helps to develop eggs in the ovaries of women.

Urofollitropin will help develop and release eggs in women who have not been able to become pregnant because of problems with ovulation, and have already received a medicine to control their pituitary gland.

This medicine is also used in women with healthy ovaries who are enrolled in a fertility program called assisted reproductive technology (ART). ART uses procedures such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). Urofollitropin is used together with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in these procedures.

Urofollitropin is often used in women who have low levels of FSH and too-high levels of LH. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome usually have hormone levels such as this and are treated with urofollitropin to make up for the low amounts of FSH. Many women being treated with urofollitropin have already tried clomiphene (eg, Serophene) and have not been able to conceive yet. Urofollitropin may also be used to cause the ovary to produce several follicles, which can then be harvested for use in gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) or in vitro fertilization (IVF).

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
