This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of indomethacin rectal suppositories in children up to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of indomethacin rectal suppositories in the elderly. However, elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of indomethacin than younger adults, and are more likely to have unwanted effects (eg, stomach ulcers, confusion, psychosis) and age-related kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving indomethacin rectal suppositories.
