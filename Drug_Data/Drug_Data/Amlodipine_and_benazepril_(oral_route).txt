Description:
Amlodipine and benazepril is a combination of medicines that are used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.

Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker (CCB). It affects the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. This relaxes the blood vessels and lowers blood pressure. A lower blood pressure will increase the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.

Benazepril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes the blood vessels to tighten. This relaxes the blood vessels and lowers blood pressure.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Capsule
