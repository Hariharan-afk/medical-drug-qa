Brand Name:

USBrand Name:
Nubain


Description:
Nalbuphine injection is used to relieve moderate to severe pain. It may also be given before and after a surgery or with a general anesthesia before an operation. It may also be used to relieve pain while giving birth.

Nalbuphine belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines). It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain.

When a nalbuphine injection is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
