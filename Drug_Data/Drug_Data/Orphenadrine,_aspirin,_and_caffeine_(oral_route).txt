Orphengesic Forte


Description:
Orphenadrine, aspirin, and caffeine combination is used to relieve mild to moderate pain in patients with acute (short-term) muscle or bone problems. It helps relax certain muscles in your body, which relieves the pain and discomfort caused by strains, sprains, or other injury to your muscles. However, this medicine does not take the place of rest, exercise, or other treatment that your doctor may recommend for your medical problem.

Orphenadrine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) to produce its muscle relaxant effects. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used to relieve pain and reduce fever. Caffeine is a CNS stimulant that is used together with pain relievers to increase their effect.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
