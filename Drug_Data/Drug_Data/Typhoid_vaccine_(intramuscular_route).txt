Typhoid Vi Polysaccharide Vaccine


Description:
Typhoid vaccine is used to prevent typhoid fever caused by a germ called  Salmonella typhi . The vaccine works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.

Typhoid fever is a serious disease that can cause death. It is spread most often through infected food or water. Typhoid may also be spread by close person-to-person contact with infected persons (such as occurs with persons living in the same household). Some infected persons do not appear to be sick, but they can still spread the germ to others.

Typhoid fever is very rare in the U.S. and other areas of the world that have good water and sewage (waste) systems. However, it is a problem in parts of the world that do not have such systems. If you are traveling to certain countries or remote, out-of-the-way areas, typhoid vaccine will help protect you from typhoid fever. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) currently recommend caution in the following areas of the world:

-> Africa
-> Asia
-> Latin America
Typhoid vaccine given by injection helps prevent typhoid fever, but does not provide 100% protection. Therefore, it is very important to avoid infected persons and food and water that may be infected, even if you have received the vaccine.

This vaccine is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor or other health care professional.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Solution

Before Using:
In deciding to use a vaccine, the risks of taking the vaccine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this vaccine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of typhoid vaccine in children 2 years of age and older. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 2 years of age.


Geriatric:
No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of typhoid vaccine in geriatric patients.


Breastfeeding:
Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.

Other Medical Problems:
The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this vaccine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

Proper Use:
A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this vaccine. It is given as a shot into one of your muscles, usually in the upper arm.

To get the best possible protection against typhoid, you should receive the vaccine at least 2 weeks before you travel to areas where you may be exposed to typhoid.

If you will be traveling regularly to parts of the world where typhoid is a problem, you should get a booster (repeat) dose of the vaccine every 2 years.


Precautions:
Be sure to notify your doctor of any side effects (eg, feeling faint) that occur after you receive this vaccine.

This vaccine may cause a serious type of allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, swelling of the tongue and throat, or troubled breathing after you get the injection.

Typhoid vaccine may not protect everyone who receives it. This vaccine will not treat the symptoms if you already have typhoid fever.

Tell your doctor if you are using a medicine or treatment that weakens your immune system, such as a steroid, radiation, or cancer treatment. This vaccine may not work as well if you are also using these medicines. However, your doctor may still want you to get the vaccine because it can give you some protection.
