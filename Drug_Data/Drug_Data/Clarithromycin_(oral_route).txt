Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.

Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of clarithromycin to treat bacterial infections in children younger than 6 months of age, and to prevent and treat  Mycobacterium avium  complex in children younger than 20 months of age.

Geriatric:

However, elderly patients are more likely to have severe kidney problems and heart rhythm problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving clarithromycin.
