Description:
Atenolol injection is used to reduce the risk of death from an acute heart attack. It is given to people who have already had a heart attack .

This medicine is a beta-blocker. It works by affecting the response to nerve impulses in certain parts of the body, like the heart. As a result, the heart beats slower and decreases the blood pressure. When the blood pressure is lowered, the amount of blood and oxygen is increased to the heart .

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription .
