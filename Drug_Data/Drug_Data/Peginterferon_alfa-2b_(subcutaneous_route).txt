Description:
Peginterferon alfa-2b injection is a synthetic (man-made) version of substances normally produced in the body to fight infection. Peginterferon alfa-2b injection is used alone or together with ribavirin and another drug called a hepatitic C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease inhibitor (eg, boceprevir or telaprevir) to treat chronic hepatitis C infection. It is used for patients who have never been treated by alpha interferons. The combination treatment of peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin is used to treat adults and children 3 years of age and older who show symptoms of liver damage.

Peginterferon alfa-2b injection is also used to prevent malignant melanoma (a type of skin cancer) from coming back after it has been removed by surgery. This medicine should be started within 84 days of surgery to remove lymph nodes containing cancer.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

Proper Use:
A nurse or other trained health professional may give you or your child this medicine. It is given as a shot under your skin, usually in the stomach, thigh, or upper arm. If you are very thin, it should only be given as a shot under the skin of your thigh or outer surface of your arm. You may also be taught how to give this medicine at home. Make sure you understand all of the instructions before giving yourself an injection. Do not use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor tells you to.

If you use this medicine at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems from the injections. Do not inject into skin areas that are red, bruised, irritated, or infected, or have scars, stretch marks, or lumps.

Each package of peginterferon alfa-2b injection contains a Medication Guide and a patient instruction sheet. Read this sheet carefully and make sure you understand:

-> How to prepare the injection.
-> How to give the injection.
-> How long the injection is stable for.
If you have any questions about any of this, check with your doctor.

Use only the brand of this medicine that your doctor prescribed. Different brands may not work the same way.

Check the medicine in the pen or vial. It should look like a white to off-white tablet that is whole, or in pieces, or powdered. Gently swirl the pen or vial after adding water in it. Do not use the medicine if it is cloudy, discolored, or has particles in it. Do not shake.

Use the pen or vial only one time. Throw away any leftover medicine.

If you are using this medicine at home, your doctor may tell you to inject the medicine at bedtime and to take a fever medicine (eg, acetaminophen, Tylenol®) 30 minutes before the injection. This helps prevent common "flu-like" symptoms such as fever, chills, headaches, muscle or joint pain, or tiredness. Also, drinking extra fluids may help if you experience these unwanted effects.


Dosing:
The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.

The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.

Peginterferon alfa-2b injection combined with ribavirin can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets in the blood, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you or your child can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

-> If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
-> Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
-> Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
-> Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
-> Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
-> Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.
Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, unusual tiredness or weakness, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.

Peginterferon alfa-2b injection when used together with ribavirin may cause teeth and gum problems. These medicines may cause dryness of the mouth, and a dry mouth may damage your teeth and gums if you take these medicines for a long time. To help prevent this condition, carefully brush your teeth at least two times a day and have regular visits with your dentist. For temporary relief of mouth dryness, use sugarless candy or gum, melt bits of ice in your mouth, or use a saliva substitute.

Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have symptoms that could lead to pancreatitis (swelling of the pancreas). This includes sudden and severe stomach pain, chills, constipation, nausea, vomiting, fever, or lightheadedness.

Children who use peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination may have weight loss and slowed growth. Most children have a growth spurt and gain weight after treatment ends. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.

Peripheral neuropathy may occur if you use this medicine together with telbivudine (Tyzeka®). Check with your doctor right away if you or your child are having burning, numbness, tingling, or painful sensations in the arms, hands, legs, or feet.
