Description:
Bevacizumab injection is given with other medicines to treat patients with metastatic (cancer that has spread) carcinoma of the colon or rectum. This medicine is also used to treat a certain type of metastatic lung cancer called nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer, and a certain type of brain tumor called glioblastoma that keeps coming back (recurrent).

Bevacizumab injection is also used in combination with other medicines (eg, interferon alfa) to treat patients with metastatic kidney cancer. It is also used in combination with other medicines (eg, paclitaxel and cisplatin, or paclitaxel and topotecan) to treat patients with cervical cancer that is continuing, keeps coming back, or has spread to other parts of the body. This medicine is also used in combination with other medicines (eg, paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, carboplatin and paclitaxel, or carboplatin and gemcitabine followed by Avastin® alone) to treat patients with platinum-resistant, recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer with or without having previous surgery.

Bevacizumab injection is also used together with atezolizumab to treat a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that has spread throughout the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) in patients who have not received other cancer medicines by mouth or injection.

Bevacizumab is a substance that helps the body fight cancer. It prevents the growth of certain types of blood vessels to cancer cells. This helps to decrease the growth of cancer cells by starving the cells of nutrients that are needed to grow.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.

A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a medical facility. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins. It must be given slowly, so the needle will have to stay in place for at least 30 to 90 minutes every 2 or 3 weeks. Your doctor will decide how many treatments you will need.

Bevacizumab is often given together with other cancer medicines. If you are using a combination of medicines, make sure that you take each one at the proper time and do not mix them. Ask your doctor to help you plan a way to remember to take your medicines at the right times.

Bevacizumab can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

-> If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
-> Check with your doctor right away if you start to cough up blood or if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
-> Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
-> Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
