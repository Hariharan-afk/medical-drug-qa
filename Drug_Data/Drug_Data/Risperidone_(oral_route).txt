Description:
Risperidone is used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or irritability associated with autistic disorder. This medicine should not be used to treat behavioral problems in older adults who have dementia.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of risperidone in children younger than 13 years of age with schizophrenia, in children younger than 10 years of age with bipolar disorder, or in children younger than 5 years of age with autistic disorder. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of risperidone have not been performed in the geriatric population, geriatric-specific problems are not expected to limit the usefulness of risperidone in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving risperidone.

There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.
