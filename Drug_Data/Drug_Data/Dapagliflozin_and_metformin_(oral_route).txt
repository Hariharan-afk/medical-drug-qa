Description:
Dapagliflozin and metformin combination is used together with proper diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes. It is also used to lower the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular (heart or blood vessel) disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors. This medicine is also used to lower the risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalization, and urgent heart failure visit in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (the heart is weak and cannot pump enough blood to the rest of the body).

Dapagliflozin and metformin combination is also used to lower the risk of worsening of kidney disease, end stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Dapagliflozin works in the kidneys to prevent absorption of glucose (blood sugar). This helps lower the blood sugar level. Metformin reduces the absorption of sugar from the stomach, reduces the release of stored sugar from the liver, and helps your body use sugar better. It does not help patients who have insulin-dependent or type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetic patients must use insulin injections.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet, Extended Release

Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of dapagliflozin and metformin combination in the elderly.

Check with your doctor right away if you have fever, unusual tiredness or weakness, or pain, tenderness, redness, or swelling of the area between and around your anus and genitals.

This medicine may cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). This is more common when this medicine is taken together with other diabetes medicines (eg, insulin, glipizide, glyburide). The symptoms of low blood sugar must be treated before they cause you to pass out. People feel different symptoms with low blood sugar . It is important that you learn which symptoms you usually have so you can treat it quickly.
