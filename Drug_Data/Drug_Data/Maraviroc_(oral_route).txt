Description:
Maraviroc is used in combination with other medicines, in the treatment of the infection caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This medicine is usually given to patients who have received HIV treatment in the past.

Maraviroc will not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS. It helps keep the HIV virus from reproducing, and appears to slow down the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay the development of problems that usually result from AIDS or HIV disease. Maraviroc will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have some of the problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
