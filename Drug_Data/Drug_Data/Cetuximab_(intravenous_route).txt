Description:
Cetuximab injection is used together with radiation treatment for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), or with a platinum-based cancer medicine with fluorouracil to treat SCCHN that has come back (recurrent) or has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic).

Your doctor will test for the presence of this gene mutation. Cetuximab injection is also used alone to treat patients with mCRC who have received other medicines (eg, irinotecan, oxaliplatin) that did not work well.

Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, such as a skin rash, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects do not occur until months or years after the medicine is used.

This medicine should only be given by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.
