Description:
Apixaban is used to treat or prevent deep venous thrombosis, a condition in which harmful blood clots form in the blood vessels of the legs. These blood clots can travel to the lungs and can become lodged in the blood vessels of the lungs, causing a condition called pulmonary embolism. This medicine is used for several days after hip or knee replacement surgery while you are unable to walk. It is during this time that blood clots are most likely to form.

Apixaban is also used to prevent stroke and blood clots in patients with certain heart rhythm problem (eg, nonvalvular atrial fibrillation).

Apixaban is a factor Xa inhibitor, an anticoagulant. It works by decreasing the clotting ability of the blood and helps preventing harmful clots from forming in the blood vessels.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
