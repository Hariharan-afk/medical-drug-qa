Description:
Azelastine and fluticasone combination nasal spray is used to treat symptoms (eg, stuffy or runny nose, itching, sneezing) of seasonal (short-term) allergic rhinitis (hay fever).

Azelastine is an antihistamine. It works by preventing the effects of a substance called histamine, which is produced by the body. Histamine can cause itching, sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes.

Fluticasone belongs to the family of medicines known as corticosteroids (cortisone-like medicine). It works by preventing certain cells from releasing substances that cause an allergic reaction.
