Description:
Ambrisentan is used to treat symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension, which is high blood pressure in the main artery that carries blood from the right side of the heart (the ventricle) to the lungs, to improve your ability to exercise and slow down the worsening of your condition. It is also used together with tadalafil to decrease the risk of disease progression and hospitalization, and to improve exercise ability. When the small blood vessels in the lungs become more resistant to blood flow, the right ventricle must work harder to pump enough blood through the lungs. Ambrisentan works by relaxing these blood vessels and increasing the supply of blood to the lungs, which reduces the workload of the heart.

This medicine is available only through a special restricted distribution program called the Letairis® REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) Program.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
