To use the skin patch:

-> Make sure you wash your hands with soap and water after applying the patch. Do not use a hand sanitizer in place of soap and water.
-> Do not use the patch if it is cut or damaged. When handling the skin patch, be careful not to touch the adhesive (sticky) surface with your hand. The adhesive part of the system contains some dextroamphetamine which can be absorbed into your body too fast through the skin of your hand. Wash your hands with soap and water if you accidentally touch the sticky side of the patch. Apply the patch right away after removing it from the protective pouch.
-> Apply the patch 2 hours before the needed effect and remove it after 9 hours. Do not wear patches for longer than 9 hours a day total. Choose a different place on your skin to apply the new patch. Do not put a new patch in the same place for at least one day (24 hours). Do not leave the patch on for more than 9 hours. It will not work as well after that time and it may irritate your skin.
-> Apply the patch to a clean, dry, and healthy skin area on your chest, hip, flank (side of the waist), upper arm, or upper back. Choose an area that is free of scars, cuts, burns, rashes, that has very little to no hair, or any other skin irritation. Avoid putting the patch on areas where it could be rubbed by tight clothing (eg, waistbands or straps). Do not shave the skin where you will apply the patch. You may cut the hair with a pair of scissors.
-> Remove the liner covering the sticky side of the skin patch. Place the sticky side against the skin. Slowly peel the clear liner while applying gentle pressure with fingers of your other hand to smooth the patch firmly in place, press the patch firmly with the palm of your hands to make sure there is good contact with your skin, especially around the edges of the patch.
-> Do not put lotion, gel, oil, or powder on the skin area where the patch will be placed. Do not expose the application site to direct heat (including hair dryer, heating pad or electric blankets, heat lamps, saunas, hot tubs, and heated water beds).
-> The patch might come off if you go swimming or take a bath or shower. If the edges lift, smooth down the patch and press firmly with the palm of your hand. Do not reapply with dressings, tape, or other adhesives. If the patch falls off after applying it, throw it away and apply a new patch in a different area.
-> You may apply oil-based product or water and soap to remove any glue on your skin.
