Description:
Amlodipine is used alone or together with other medicines to treat hypertension (high blood pressure). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.

Amlodipine is also used to relieve chronic stable angina (chest pain) or vasospastic angina (Prinzmetal's or variant angina). This medicine is also used to lower the risk of hospitalization for angina and heart surgery (eg, coronary revascularization) in patients with recently documented coronary artery disease (CAD) by angiography and without certain heart problems (eg, heart failure or an ejection fraction less than 40%).

Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker. It works by affecting the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. This relaxes the blood vessels and lowers blood pressure, and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its workload.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Solution

Before Using:

Geriatric:
