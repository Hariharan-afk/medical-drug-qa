Description:
Everolimus is used to treat advanced (late-stage) cancers or noncancerous tumors, such as kidney and breast cancer, subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA, a brain tumor), renal angiomyolipoma (kidney tumor), and partial-onset seizures (epilepsy) with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), and neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas, stomach or bowels, and lungs. It is used for patients who have already received other medicines that did not work well or those who will not be treated with surgery.

Everolimus works by interfering with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected, other unwanted effects will also occur. It belongs to the group of medicines known as antineoplastics (cancer medicines).

Everolimus is also used together with other medicines to prevent the body from rejecting a transplanted organ (eg, kidney or liver) in patients who have received kidney or liver transplant. This medicine may be used with cyclosporine, steroids, basiliximab, or tacrolimus. When a patient receives an organ transplant, the body's white blood cells may try to get rid of (reject) the transplanted organ. Everolimus works to suppress the immune system and prevents the white blood cells from getting rid of the transplanted organ.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet
-> Tablet for Suspension

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of everolimus  in children 1 year of age and older to treat SEGA brain tumors  and  in children 2 years of age and older to treat partial-onset seizures . However, use is not recommended  in children younger than 1 year of age to treat SEGA brain tumors  and  in children younger than 2 years of age to treat partial-onset seizures .

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of everolimus when used for  kidney cancer, neuroendocrine tumors,  and  kidney or liver transplants  in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of everolimus in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted side effects, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving everolimus.

Precautions:
It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits  to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. It may also cause birth defects if the father is using it when his sexual partner becomes pregnant. Female patients should use an effective form of birth control during treatment with this medicine and for at least 8 weeks after the last dose. Male patients who have female partners should use effective birth control during treatment with Afinitor®  or Afinitor® Disperz  and for 4 weeks after the last dose. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.

If you are planning to have children, talk with your doctor before using this medicine. Some men and women using this medicine have become infertile (unable to have children).

This medicine may cause a serious lung problem called interstitial lung disease or non-infectious pneumonitis. Check with your doctor right away if you have chest pain, chills, cough, fever, or trouble breathing.

Check with your doctor right away if you have bloody urine, a decrease in frequency or amount of urine, an increase in blood pressure, increased thirst, loss of appetite, lower back or side pain, nausea, swelling of the face, fingers, or lower legs, trouble breathing, unusual tiredness or weakness, vomiting, or weight gain. These may be symptoms of a serious kidney problem.

While you are being treated with everolimus, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Everolimus may lower your body's resistance and the vaccine may not work as well or you might get the infection the vaccine is meant to prevent. In addition, you should not be around other persons living in your household who receive live virus vaccines because there is a chance they could pass the virus on to you. Some examples of live virus vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.

Everolimus can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, which increases the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

-> If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor right away if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
-> Check with your doctor right away if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
-> Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
-> Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
-> Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
-> Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.
This medicine may increase your risk for getting skin cancer. When you begin taking this medicine:

-> Stay out of direct sunlight, especially between the hours of 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM, if possible.
-> Wear protective clothing, including a hat and sunglasses.
-> Apply a sunblock product that has a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 or higher if you have a fair complexion.
-> Apply a sunblock lipstick that has an SPF of at least 15 to protect your lips.
-> Do not use sunlamps, tanning beds, or tanning booths.
-> If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.
This medicine may cause a serious allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after using this medicine.

Everolimus may cause a serious allergic reaction called angioedema, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. This may occur more often when it is used with certain heart and blood pressure medicines called ACE inhibitors (eg, captopril [Capoten®], enalapril [Vasotec®], fosinopril [Monopril®], quinapril [Accupril®], ramipril [Altace®]). Check with your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, a large, hive-like swelling on the face, eyelids, lips, tongue, throat, hands, legs, feet, or genitals, trouble breathing, or chest tightness while you are using this medicine.

If you have a kidney or liver transplant , this medicine may increase your risk for having a blood clot in the new kidney. This usually occurs within the first 30 days after the kidney transplant. Check with your doctor right away if you are making less urine, or if you have pain in your groin, lower back, side, or stomach, dark urine, fever, nausea, or vomiting.

This medicine may also prevent you from healing correctly after an injury. Do not take this medicine at least 1 week before surgery and at least 2 weeks after a surgery. Call your doctor right away if you have blood, fluid, or pus in your incision, your incision opens up, or if it is red, warm, painful, or swollen.

This medicine may also increase your risk of bleeding and cause delay in wound healing. Stay away from rough sports or other situations where you could be bruised, cut, or injured. Brush and floss your teeth gently. Be careful when using sharp objects, including razors and fingernail clippers. Check with your doctor immediately if you or your child notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.

This medicine may increase your cholesterol and fats in the blood. If this condition occurs, your doctor may give you or your child some medicines that can lower the amount of cholesterol and fats in the blood.

Make sure any doctor who treats you knows that you are using this medicine. This medicine may worsen the side effects from radiation treatment.

If you are taking this medicine after a kidney transplant , it may increase your risk for developing rare and serious virus infections, including polyoma virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), progressive multiple leukoencephalopathy (PML), and BK virus-associated nephropathy (BKVAN). The BK virus may affect how your kidneys work and cause a transplanted kidney to fail. Check with your doctor right away if you have bloody urine, a decreased frequency or amount of urine, increased thirst, loss of appetite, lower back or side pain, nausea, swelling of the face, fingers, or lower legs, trouble breathing, unusual tiredness or weakness, vomiting, or weight gain.

This medicine may cause thrombotic microangiopathy (damage in the smallest blood vessels), hemolytic uremic syndrome, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Tell your doctor right away if you have a change in mental status, dark or bloody urine, decreased urine output, difficulty speaking, fever, pale color of the skin, pinpoint red spots on the skin, seizures, severe chest pain, sudden weakness in the arms or legs, unusual bleeding or bruising, or yellow eyes or skin.

Everolimus may cause mouth ulcers and sores in some patients. Tell your doctor right away if you have pain, discomfort, or open sores in your mouth while you are using this medicine. You may use a special mouthwash (eg, dexamethasone alcohol-free oral solution) or mouth gel to treat these ulcers. Ask your doctor what type of products to use.

This medicine may affect blood sugar levels. If you have diabetes, check with your doctor if you notice a change in your blood or urine sugar tests.

Tell your doctor if you are taking a corticosteroid or another medicine that may weaken your immune system. This may increase your risk for developing a serious infection.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal (eg, cannabidiol, St. John's Wort) or vitamin supplements.
