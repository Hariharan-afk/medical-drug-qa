Description:
Macitentan treats symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension, which is high blood pressure in the main artery that carries blood from the right side of the heart (the ventricle) to the lungs. When the small blood vessels in the lungs become more resistant to blood flow, the right ventricle must work harder to pump enough blood through the lungs. Macitentan works by relaxing these blood vessels and increasing the supply of blood to the lungs, which reduces the workload of the heart.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
