Description:
Ixabepilone injection is used alone or together with other medicine (eg, capecitabine) to treat metastatic (cancer that has spread) or locally advanced breast cancer in patients who have received other cancer treatments (eg, anthracyclines, taxanes, and capecitabine) that did not work well.

Ixabepilone injection belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics (cancer medicines). It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells will also be affected by this medicine, other side effects may occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor right away.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
