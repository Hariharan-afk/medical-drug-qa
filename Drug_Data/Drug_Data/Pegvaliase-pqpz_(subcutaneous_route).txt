If you use this medicine at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. Do not inject into skin areas that are tender, red, bruised, hard, burned, inflamed, or has scars, birthmarks, rashes, moles, or tattoos.

If more than one injection is needed, you may inject into the body area at least 2 inches away from each other. The second injection site can be on the same or different part of the body.
