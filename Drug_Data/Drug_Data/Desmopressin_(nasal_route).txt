Description:
Desmopressin nasal spray is used to treat central cranial diabetes insipidus. This is a condition that causes the body to lose too much fluid and become dehydrated. It is also used to control frequent urination and increased thirst caused by certain types of brain injury or brain surgery. The  Stimate®  nasal spray is used to treat bleeding in patients with hemophilia A or von Willebrand disease (Type I).

Noctiva™  nasal spray is used to treat nocturnal polyuria in adults who awaken two or more times to urinate at night. Nocturnal polyuria is a condition where your body makes too much urine at night. Your doctor will need to measure your urine and the times that you urinate for 24 hours to determine if you have nocturnal polyuria.

Desmopressin is similar to a hormone that is produced in the body. It acts on the kidneys to reduce the flow of urine. For bleeding, desmopressin increases the blood levels of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor. This results in less bleeding for patients who have low levels of these agents.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Spray

Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of desmopressin nasal spray to treat  central diabetes insipidus  in  children 3 months of age and older for desmopressin acetate  or in  children 4 years of age and older for DDAVP® . Safety and efficacy have been established.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of  Stimate®  to treat hemophilia A and von Willebrand disease in children 11 months of age and older. However, use is not recommended in children younger than 11 months of age.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of  Noctiva™  in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of desmopressin nasal spray in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving desmopressin.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of  Noctiva™  in the elderly.
