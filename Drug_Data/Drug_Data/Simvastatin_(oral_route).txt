Description:
Simvastatin is used together with a proper diet to treat high cholesterol and triglyceride (fat) levels in the blood. This medicine may help prevent medical problems (eg, heart or blood vessel problems, heart attacks, or strokes) caused by clogged blood vessels. Simvastatin may also be used to prevent certain types of heart problems in patients with risk factors for heart problems.

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.

Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of simvastatin in children younger than 10 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

Teenage girls taking simvastatin should be counseled on appropriate birth control methods to prevent pregnancy.


Geriatric:
