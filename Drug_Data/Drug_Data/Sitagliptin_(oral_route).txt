Description:
Sitagliptin is used alone or together with other medicines (eg, insulin, glimepiride, metformin, or pioglitazone) and with proper diet and exercise to treat high blood sugar levels caused by type 2 diabetes. Sitagliptin helps to control blood sugar levels by increasing substances in the body that make the pancreas release more insulin. It also signals the liver to stop producing sugar (glucose) when there is too much sugar in the blood. This medicine does not help patients who have insulin-dependent or type 1 diabetes.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet

Before Using:
