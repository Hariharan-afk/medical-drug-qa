Description:
Atorvastatin is used together with a proper diet to lower cholesterol and triglyceride (fats) levels in the blood. This medicine may help prevent medical problems (eg, chest pain, heart attack, or stroke) that are caused by fats clogging the blood vessels. It may also be used to prevent certain types of heart and blood vessel problems in patients with risk factors for heart problems.

Atorvastatin belongs to the group of medicines called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins. It works by blocking an enzyme that is needed by the body to make cholesterol, and this reduces the amount of cholesterol in the blood.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Suspension
-> Tablet

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of atorvastatin in children 10 to 17 years of age. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 10 years of age to treat  homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH)  and in children to treat  other types of high cholesterol .


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of atorvastatin in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, heart problems, or increased risk of muscle problems, which may require caution in patients receiving atorvastatin.
