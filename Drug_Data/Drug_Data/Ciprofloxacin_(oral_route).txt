Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of ciprofloxacin in children. However, because of this medicine's toxicity, it should be used with caution, after other medicines have been considered and found ineffective. Ciprofloxacin  oral liquid  or  tablet  may be used in children to prevent anthrax infection after possible exposure, and to treat serious kidney infections.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of ciprofloxacin  extended-release tablets  in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of ciprofloxacin in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney or heart problems, or develop severe tendon problems (including tendon rupture), which may require caution in patients receiving ciprofloxacin.
