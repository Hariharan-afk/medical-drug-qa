Description:
Sitagliptin and simvastatin combination is used together with a proper diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes. It is also used together with a proper diet to treat high cholesterol and triglyceride (fats) levels in the blood. This medicine may help prevent medical problems caused by clogged blood vessels such as heart attacks and strokes.

Sitagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. It helps to control blood sugar levels by increasing substances in the body that make the pancreas release more insulin. It also signals the liver to stop producing sugar (glucose) when there is too much sugar in the blood.

Simvastatin belongs to the group of medicines called statins. It works to reduce the amount of cholesterol in the blood by blocking the production of cholesterol.

This medicine was available only with your doctor's prescription.  The Juvisync™ product will no longer be marketed in the United States as of September 26, 2013, but may be available in other countries.


Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of sitagliptin and simvastatin combination in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of sitagliptin and simvastatin combination in the elderly.
