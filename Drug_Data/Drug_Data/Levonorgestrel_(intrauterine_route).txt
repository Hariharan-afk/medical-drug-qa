It works by stopping a woman's egg from fully developing each month. The egg can no longer accept a sperm and fertilization (pregnancy) is prevented.

Proper Use:
Your doctor will give you this medicine in a hospital or clinic. This intrauterine device (IUD) is inserted into your uterus.

This medicine comes with a patient information insert. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

Your doctor may want to do tests to make sure you do not have an infection before putting in an IUD. The IUD is usually inserted during your monthly period, immediately after a miscarriage or an abortion in the first trimester of your pregnancy, at least 4 to 6 weeks after a miscarriage or an abortion in the second trimester of your pregnancy, or at least 4 to 6 weeks after giving birth. Putting an IUD in during a monthly period also helps to make sure that you are not pregnant. You will also need to see your doctor within 4 to 6 weeks of having your IUD inserted and then once a year. Use another form of birth control or refrain from having sex if the IUD is not inserted during the first 7 days of your menstrual cycle.

Levonorgestrel IUD has a string or "tail" which is made of plastic thread. About one or two inches of this string hangs into your vagina. You cannot see this string, and it will not cause problems when you have sex. Check your IUD string every few days during the first few months that you have your IUD. After that, check the string after each monthly period. You may not be protected against pregnancy if you cannot feel the string or if you feel the plastic. Do the following to check the placement of your IUD:

-> Wash your hands with soap and warm water. Dry them with a clean towel.
-> Bend your knees and squat low to the ground.
-> Gently put your index (pointing) finger high inside your vagina. The cervix is at the top of the vagina and feels like the tip of your nose. Find the IUD string coming from your cervix. Never pull on the string. You should not be able to feel the firm plastic of the IUD itself.
-> Wash your hands after you are finished checking your IUD.
If you are using levonorgestrel-releasing IUD to prevent pregnancy, you will need to have your device replaced every 3 years for  Skyla® , 5 years for  Kyleena® , or 8 years for  Liletta®  and  Mirena® , or sooner if it comes out of your uterus unexpectedly.

If you are using  Liletta®  or  Mirena®  treat heavy menstrual bleeding, you will need to have it replaced every 5 years, or sooner if it comes out of your uterus unexpectedly.

If you are using  Kyleena® ,  Liletta® ,  Mirena® , or  Skyla® , and want to stop, your doctor can remove it at any time. However, you may become pregnant as soon as  Kyleena® ,  Liletta® ,  Mirena® , or  Skyla®  is removed, or if you have intercourse the week before  Liletta®  is removed. Use another form of birth control (eg, condoms, spermicides) or have a new IUD inserted at the same day of removal to keep from getting pregnant.


Precautions:
It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits  to make sure this medicine is working properly and does not cause unwanted effects. These visits will usually be 4 to 6 weeks after insertion and then once a year, but some doctors would require them more often.

There is a small chance that you could get pregnant when using an IUD, just as there is with any birth control. If you get pregnant, your doctor may remove your IUD to lower the risk of miscarriage or other problems.

Call your doctor right away if you think you have become pregnant while you are using this medicine. You may have a higher risk of an ectopic pregnancy (occurs outside the womb) if you get pregnant while your IUD is in place. This can be a serious and life-threatening condition. It can also cause problems that may make it harder for you to become pregnant in the future.

An IUD can slip partly or all the way out of your uterus without you knowing it. If this happens, you will have no protection against getting pregnant or you may have an increased risk for serious problems. This is more likely during the first year that you have your IUD, but it can happen at any time. Regularly checking the string of your IUD can tell you if it is still in place.

You may have some blood spotting and cramping during the first few weeks after the IUD has been inserted. These symptoms should go away within a few months. Rarely, the IUD may make a hole in the wall of your uterus when it is inserted. If this happens, check with your doctor right away.

Using Kyleena® , Liletta® , Mirena® , or Skyla®  can increase your risk for severe infections, including sepsis. This is a rare and life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this risk.

An IUD can increase your risk of having a serious infection of the female organs, called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or endometritis (pregnancy-related), which can be serious, even life threatening. This infection could cause scarring of the female organs, which may make it hard for you to become pregnant in the future, and can increase your risk of ectopic pregnancy.

Call your doctor right away if you have flu-like symptoms, fever, chills, cramps, pain, bleeding, or fluid leaking from your vagina. These may be signs that you have an infection.

This medicine may increase your risk of having ovarian cysts or cancer of the breast, uterus, or cervix. It may also cause yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes (jaundice). Talk to your doctor if these concern you.

This medicine may also increase your risk of having high blood pressure (hypertension), clotting problems, or serious heart and blood vessel problems including heart attack or stroke. Check with your doctor right away if you start having dizziness, fainting spells, severe tiredness, chest pain, trouble with breathing, sudden or severe headache, problems with vision, speech, or walking, or unusual bleeding, bruising, or weakness.

This device will not protect you from getting HIV/AIDS, herpes, or other sexually transmitted diseases. Tell your doctor if you or your partner begins to have sexual intercourse with other people, or you or your partner tests positive for a sexually transmitted disease. If this is a concern for you, talk with your doctor.

It is important to tell your doctor that you are using this medicine before you have a medical procedure, such as magnetic resonance imaging or MRI.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal (eg, St. John's wort) or vitamin supplements.
