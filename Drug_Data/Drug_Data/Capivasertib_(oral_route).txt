Description:
Capivasertib is used in combination with fulvestrant to treat HR-positive, HER-2 negative breast cancer that is advanced or metastatic (cancer that has spread) in patients with abnormal genes (eg, PIK3CA, AKT1, or PTEN) that has progressed on or after receiving endocrine treatment. Your doctor will test for the presence of the mutation.

Capivasertib belongs to the group of medicines, called antineoplastics. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by the medicine, other unwanted effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.
