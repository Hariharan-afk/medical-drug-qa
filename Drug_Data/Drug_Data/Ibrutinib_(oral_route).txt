Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of ibrutinib to  treat chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGHVD)  in children younger than 1 year of age and to  treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL) with 17p deletion, and Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM)  in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of ibrutinib in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted effects (eg, anemia, pneumonia, bleeding problems, high blood pressure, heart rhythm problems), which may require caution in patients receiving ibrutinib.

Ibrutinib can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

-> Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
-> Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
-> Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
-> Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
-> Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.
Check with your doctor right away if you have chest pain or tightness, decreased urine output, dilated neck veins, irregular breathing, irregular heartbeat, swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs, trouble breathing, unusual tiredness or weakness, or weight gain.
