Description:
Norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol combination contraceptive skin patch is used to prevent pregnancy. Hormones from the patch are absorbed through your skin into your body. It works by stopping a woman's egg from fully developing each month. The egg can no longer accept a sperm and fertilization (pregnancy) is prevented.

This patch allows more estrogen into the blood than oral birth control containing the same amount of estrogen.

No contraceptive method is 100 percent effective. Birth control methods such as having surgery to become sterile or not having sex are more effective. Discuss with your doctor your options for birth control.

Norelgestromin and ethinyl Estradiol combination does not prevent AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases. It will not prevent hepatitis B. It will not help as emergency contraception, such as after unprotected sexual contact.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Patch, Extended Release

This transdermal patch system is to be used for 28 days (four-week) cycle. A new patch is applied each week for 3 weeks (21 days), and week four is patch-free.

When you begin using norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol combination transdermal, your body will require at least 7 days to adjust before a pregnancy will be prevented. Use a second form of contraception (eg, condoms, spermicides, diaphragms) for the first 7 days of your first patch cycle.

To use this patch :

-> Keep each patch in the package until you are ready to use it.
-> Wash your hands with soap and water before and after applying a patch.
-> Apply the patch to clean, dry, and intact skin on the abdomen or stomach, upper body, the upper outside part of the arm, or the buttocks. Avoid touching the sticky surface of the patch.
-> Make sure there is no lotion, powder, cream, or make-up on the skin.
-> Apply the patch and then press it with the palm of your hand for 10 seconds to make sure it sticks.
-> Change the location of the patch each time you apply a new one. Do not apply a patch to skin that is injured, broken, or cut. Do not apply a patch to your breasts. Check the patch every day to make sure it is in place.
If the patch comes off partly or all the way, try to apply it again or apply a new patch. If it becomes loose  less than 24 hours , no other form of birth control is needed. If the patch has peeled away  for more than 24 hours , apply a new patch and start a new cycle. A second form of birth control should also be used.

If the patch is not sticky or has stuck to material or itself, remove it and apply a new patch. Do not hold the patch in place with tape or wraps.

If you are switching from a contraceptive pill or vaginal ring to using the patch , start the patch on the first day of your period on the day that you would usually use your next pill or vaginal ring for  Xulane® . If your period does not start after 1 week for  Xulane® , you should see your doctor for a pregnancy test.  If you apply Xulane® more than 1 week after using your last pill or vaginal ring , use a second method of birth control with the patch for the first 7 days.

If you have a miscarriage or an abortion in the first trimester of your pregnancy , you may start norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol combination transdermal right away. You do not need a second form of birth control. If you start this medicine 5 days or more after the miscarriage or abortion, you should use a second form of birth control with the patch for the first 24 hours during the start of your menstrual period or for the first 7 days on the first Sunday of your menstruation. If you have a miscarriage or abortion after the first trimester, you should wait for 4 weeks before starting this medicine.

If you use this patch after giving birth and choose not to breastfeed , you may start after 4 weeks to prevent the risk of having blood clots.

If you have bleeding with the patch in place, continue to use the patches as usual. If the bleeding continues for 2–3 cycles, call your doctor. If you do not have your period during the time the patch is off, stay on your regular schedule and call your doctor.

If the patch is uncomfortable or causes irritation, change to a new patch in a new location. Change the patch again on your regular schedule. Do not use more than one patch at a time.

When you remove a patch, carefully fold it in half so that it sticks to itself and throw it away. There will still be some hormones on the patch. Do not touch the inside of the patch.

Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you are using this medicine. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice may change the amount of this medicine that is absorbed in the body.
