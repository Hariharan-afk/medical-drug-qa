Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of crovalimab-akkz injection in children younger than 13 years of age weighing less than 40 kilograms (kg). Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of crovalimab-akkz injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related heart, kidney, or liver problems, which may require caution in patients receiving this medicine.


Breastfeeding:
There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.


Drug Interactions:
Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.


Other Interactions:
Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.  Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.  Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.


Other Medical Problems:
The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

-> Infection—Use with caution. May increase risk of serious infections.
-> Meningococcal infection, serious and unresolved—Should not be used in patients with this condition.

Proper Use:
A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine. The first loading dose is given through an IV catheter that is placed into one of your veins. It must be injected slowly, so your IV may need to stay in place for at least 60 to 90 minutes on Day 1. Another loading dose will be given as a shot under your skin, usually in the stomach, on Days 2, 8, 15, and 22. The maintenance doses will begin on Day 29 and be given every 4 weeks as a shot under your skin.

It is very important that you understand the requirements of the Piasky™ REMS program, and become familiar with the Piasky™ Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions. Ask your pharmacist for the medication guide if you do not have one.

If you are changing treatment from Soliris® or Ultomiris® to Piasky™, you should start receiving Piasky™ as soon as possible. Your doctor will monitor you for 30 days after you switch medicines.


Missed Dose:
