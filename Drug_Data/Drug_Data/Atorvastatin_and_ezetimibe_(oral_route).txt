Liptruzet


Description:
Ezetimibe and atorvastatin combination is used together with a proper diet to treat high cholesterol and triglyceride (fats) levels in the blood. This medicine may help prevent medical problems (eg, heart attack, stroke) caused by clogged blood vessels. It is also used to treat a condition called homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH).

Ezetimibe is a cholesterol absorption inhibitor and atorvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, or statin. These medicines will reduce the absorption of cholesterol from foods and the production of cholesterol in your body.

This medicine was available only with your doctor's prescription.

The atorvastatin/ezetimibe combination (Liptruzet(R)) was withdrawn from the United States market on June 2, 2015.
