Ibucodone


Description:
Hydrocodone and ibuprofen combination is used to relieve short-term pain severe enough to require opioid treatment and when other pain medicines did not work well enough or cannot be tolerated. This medicine should only be used for short periods of time, usually for a total of less than 10 days. This combination is not used for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.

Hydrocodone is an opioid analgesic that acts on the central nervous system to relieve pain. If hydrocodone is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming (causing mental or physical dependence). However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using opioids to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is less likely to occur when opioids are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking the medicine. Since hydrocodone and ibuprofen combination is only used for short-term (10 days or less) relief of pain, physical dependence will probably not occur.

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used in this combination to relieve inflammation, swelling, and pain.

This medicine is available only under a restricted distribution program called the Opioid Analgesic REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of hydrocodone and ibuprofen combination in children younger than 16 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of hydrocodone and ibuprofen combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to develop age-related kidney, heart, lung, or stomach problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving this medicine.
