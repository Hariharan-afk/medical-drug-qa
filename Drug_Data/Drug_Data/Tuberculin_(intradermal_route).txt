Description:
Tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) is used in a skin test to help diagnose tuberculosis (TB) infection in persons at increased risk of developing active disease.

Tuberculin skin test is done by injecting tuberculin PPD into the surface layer of the skin. If the test is positive, a reaction will be seen at and around the place of injection or puncture. If the test is given using an injection, this reaction is usually a hard, raised area with clear margins. If the test is given using the puncture devices, the reaction is usually a swollen area at the puncture site. The size of the reaction is measured and recorded and the results of the test are studied after 48 to 72 hours.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the supervision of a doctor.
