USBrand Name:
Viread


Description:
Tenofovir is used in combination with other medicines for the treatment of the infection caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV is the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Tenofovir will not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS. It helps keep HIV from reproducing and appears to slow down the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay problems that are usually related to AIDS or HIV disease from occurring. Tenofovir will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have some of the problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.

Tenofovir is also used to treat chronic (long-term) hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

Before Using:

Geriatric:

Precautions:

Two rare but serious reactions to this medicine are lactic acidosis (build-up of acid in the blood) and liver toxicity. These are more common if you are female, very overweight (obese), or have been taking antiviral medicines for a long time.
