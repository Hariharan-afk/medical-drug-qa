Description:
Trandolapril is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.

Trandolapril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes the blood vessels to tighten. As a result, trandolapril relaxes the blood vessels. This lowers blood pressure and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.

Trandolapril is used to treat congestive heart failure. It is also used in some patients after a heart attack. After a heart attack, some of the heart muscle becomes damaged and weak. The heart muscle may continue to weaken as time goes by. This makes it more difficult for the heart to pump blood. Trandolapril may be started within the first few days after a heart attack to increase survival rate. It can also help cut down on the number of hospital visits for heart problems.
