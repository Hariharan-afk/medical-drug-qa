Description:
Didanosine is used in combination with other medicines for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Didanosine will not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS. It helps keep HIV from reproducing and appears to slow down the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay the development of problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease. Didanosine will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have the problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

The buffered tablets that are to be chewed, crushed or mixed with water are no longer available in the United States. This product was voluntarily discontinued, and it was not due to safety concerns. Didanosine delayed-release capsules (Videx® EC) and pediatric powder for oral solution are still available.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
