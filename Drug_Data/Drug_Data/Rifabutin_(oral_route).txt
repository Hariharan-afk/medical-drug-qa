Rifabutin will cause your urine, stools, saliva, skin, sputum, sweat, and tears to turn reddish-orange to brown-orange. This is to be expected while you are taking this medicine. This effect may cause soft contact lenses to become permanently discolored. Standard cleaning solutions may not take out all the discoloration. It is best not to wear soft contact lenses while taking this medicine. Hard contact lenses are not discolored by rifabutin. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.

Rifabutin can lower the number of white blood cells in your blood temporarily, increasing the chance of getting infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. These problems may result in a greater chance of getting certain infections, slow healing, and bleeding of the gums. Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Dental work should be delayed until your blood counts have returned to normal. Check with your medical doctor or dentist if you have any questions about proper oral hygiene (mouth care) during treatment.

Birth control pills may not work properly if you take them while you are taking rifabutin. Unplanned pregnancies may occur. Use a different means of birth control while you are taking rifabutin. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.
