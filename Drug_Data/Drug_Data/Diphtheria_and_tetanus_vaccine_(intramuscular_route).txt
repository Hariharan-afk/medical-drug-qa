Description:
Diphtheria and tetanus vaccine is a combination vaccine that is given to protect against infections caused by diphtheria and tetanus (lockjaw). The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against these diseases. This vaccine is given to children 6 weeks of age and older, teenagers, and adults.

Diphtheria is a serious illness that can cause breathing problems, heart problems, nerve damage, pneumonia, and possibly death. The risk for serious illness is greater in very young children and the elderly.

Tetanus (also known as lockjaw) is a very serious illness that causes severe muscle spasms that make the muscles very rigid or stiff. The muscle spasms can be strong enough to cause bone fractures in the spine. The disease can also cause breathing problems, swallowing problems, seizures, and possibly death.

This vaccine is to be administered only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.
