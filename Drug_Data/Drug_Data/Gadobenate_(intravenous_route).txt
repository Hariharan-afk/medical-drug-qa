Description:
Gadobenate is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent used to help create a clear picture of the body during MRI scans. MRI scans are a special kind of diagnostic procedure. They use magnets and computers to create images or “pictures” of certain areas inside the body. Unlike x-rays, they do not involve ionizing radiation. Gadobenate is a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) that is given by injection before an MRI to help diagnose problems in the brain, spine, and other parts of your body.

This medicine is to be used only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of gadobenate injection in the pediatric population. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in preterm babies.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of gadobenate in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving gadobenate.
