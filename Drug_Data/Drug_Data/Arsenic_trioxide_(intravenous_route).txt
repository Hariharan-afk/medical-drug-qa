Description:
Arsenic trioxide injection is used together with another medicine (eg, tretinoin) to treat newly-diagnosed low-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a type of leukemia (cancer of the blood cells). It is also used to treat APL in patients who have not responded to other medication regimens. It may also be used to treat other kinds of cancer, as determined by your doctor.

Arsenic trioxide belongs to the general group of medicines called antineoplastics. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by arsenic trioxide, other unwanted effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.

Before you begin treatment with arsenic trioxide injection, you and your doctor should talk about the benefits of this medicine as well as the risks of using it.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
