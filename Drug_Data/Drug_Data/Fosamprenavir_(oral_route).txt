Description:
Fosamprenavir is used in combination with other medicines to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Fosamprenavir may slow down the destruction of the immune system caused by HIV. This may help delay problems that are usually related to AIDS or HIV disease from occurring. However, this medicine will not cure or prevent HIV infection, and it will not keep you from spreading the virus to other people. Patients who receive this medicine may continue to have other problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fosamprenavir in infants and children 4 weeks of age and older who have not taken HIV medicines in the past called protease inhibitors. Use is not recommended in children younger than 6 months of age who have taken HIV medicines called protease inhibitors in the past. Safety and efficacy have not been established in infants younger than 4 weeks of age.


Geriatric:
Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of fosamprenavir have not been performed in the geriatric population, geriatric-specific problems are not expected to limit the usefulness of fosamprenavir in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving fosamprenavir.


Breastfeeding:
There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.

Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.

Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.

Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.

The  oral suspension  may also be refrigerated. Do not freeze.


Precautions:
It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits  to make sure this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Do not use this medicine if you or your child are also using alfuzosin (Uroxatral®), cisapride (Propulsid®), delavirdine (Rescriptor®), flecainide (Tambocor®), lomitapide (Juxtapid®), lovastatin (Altocor®, Mevacor®), lurasidone (Latuda®), oral midazolam (Versed®), pimozide (Orap®), propafenone (Rythmol®), rifampin (Rifadin®, Rimactane®), sildenafil (Revatio®), simvastatin (Simcor®, Vytorin®, Zocor®), triazolam (Halcion®), or ergot medicines (eg, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine, Cafergot®, D.H.E. 45®, Ergomar®, Ergostat®, Ergotrate®, Methergine®, Migranal®, or Wigraine®).

Serious skin reactions can occur with this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, itching, white spots in the mouth or on the lips, or redness of the skin.

Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.

Your immune system may get stronger when you start taking HIV medicines. Tell your doctor right away if you notice any changes in your health. Sometimes the immune system will start to fight infections that were hidden in your body, such as pneumonia or tuberculosis, or may result in a flare-up of a hidden autoimmune disorder, such as Graves disease, polymyositis, or Guillain-Barré syndrome.

Tell your doctor if you are also using sildenafil (Viagra®), tadalafil (Cialis®), or vardenafil (Levitra®). Using these medicines together with fosamprenavir may increase your risk of having side effects such as low blood pressure, changes in vision, or prolonged erection of the penis.

Birth control pills may not work as well while you are using fosamprenavir. To keep from getting pregnant, use an additional form of birth control along with your pills. Other forms of birth control include condoms, a diaphragm, or contraceptive foam or jelly.

This medicine may increase blood sugar levels. Check with your doctor if you or your child notice a change in the results of your blood or urine sugar tests.

This medicine may cause bleeding problems, especially in patients with hemophilia (bleeding disorder). Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have back pain, blood in the eyes, blood in the urine, black, tarry stools, bruises or purple areas on the skin, decreased alertness, dizziness, headache, joint pain or swelling, nosebleeds, or coughing up blood.

This medicine may cause you to have excess body fat. Tell your doctor if you or your child notice changes in your body shape, such as an increased amount of fat in the upper back and neck, or around the chest and stomach area. You might also lose fat from the legs, arms, and face.

This medicine may increase your cholesterol and fats in the blood. If this condition occurs, your doctor may give you or your child some medicines that can lower the amount of cholesterol and fats in the blood.

This medicine may increase your risk of having kidney stones. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have blood in your urine, nausea and vomiting, pain in the groin or genitals, or sharp back pain just below the ribs.

Tell your doctor that you or your child are using this medicine before you have any medical tests. The results of some tests may be affected by this medicine.

Fosamprenavir does not decrease the risk of transmitting the HIV infection to others through sexual contact or by contamination through blood. HIV may be acquired from or spread to others through infected body fluids, including blood, vaginal fluid, or semen. If you are infected, it is best to avoid any sexual activity involving an exchange of body fluids with other people. If you do have sex, always wear (or have your partner wear) a condom (“rubber”). Only use condoms made of latex, and use them every time you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex. The use of a spermicide (eg, nonoxynol-9) may also help prevent the spread of HIV if it is not irritating to the vagina, rectum, or mouth. Spermicides have been shown to kill HIV in lab tests. Do not use oil-based jelly, cold cream, baby oil, or shortening as a lubricant—these products can cause the condom to break. Lubricants without oil, such as K-Y Jelly, are recommended. Women may wish to carry their own condoms. Birth control pills and diaphragms will help protect against pregnancy, but they will not prevent someone from giving or getting the AIDS virus. If you inject drugs, get help to stop. Do not share needles or equipment with anyone. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines, and herbal (eg, St. John's wort) or vitamin supplements.
