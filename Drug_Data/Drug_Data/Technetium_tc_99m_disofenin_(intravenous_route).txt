Before Using:
In deciding to use a diagnostic test, any risks of the test must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. Also, other things may affect test results. For this test, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.

Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of technetium Tc 99m disofenin injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of technetium Tc 99m disofenin injection have not been performed in the geriatric population, geriatric-specific problems are not expected to limit the usefulness of technetium Tc 99m disofenin injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving technetium Tc 99m disofenin injection.
