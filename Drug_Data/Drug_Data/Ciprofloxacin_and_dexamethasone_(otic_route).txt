Ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone combination ear drops is used to treat ear infections, such as acute otitis externa and acute otitis media. Otitis externa, also known as swimmer's ear, is an infection of the outer ear canal caused by bacteria. The ear canal and outer part of the ear may be swollen, red, and painful. Otitis media is a middle ear infection in children who have a tube in their eardrum (known as tympanostomy) to prevent having too much fluid in the middle ear.

Ciprofloxacin belongs to the class of medicines known as fluoroquinolone antibiotics. It works by killing the bacteria or preventing their growth. Dexamethasone is a steroid medicine that is used to relieve the redness, itching, and swelling caused by ear infections.

Proper Use:
Use this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor . Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.

-> Shake the bottle well before using it.
-> Lie down on your side with your infected ear facing up.
-> Drop the prescribed number of drops into the ear. Keep the ear tilted up for 60 seconds.
-> To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the ear). Also, keep the container tightly closed.
-> For patients with middle ear infection with tubes: While the person getting the ear drops lies on their side, the person giving the drops should gently press the small projection in front of the outside opening of the ear 5 times in a pumping motion. This will allow the drops to pass through the tube and into the middle ear.
