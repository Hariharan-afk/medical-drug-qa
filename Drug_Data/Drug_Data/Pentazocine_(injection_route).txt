Description:
Pentazocine injection is used to relieve moderate to severe pain. It may also be used before surgery or with a general anesthetic (medicine that puts you to sleep). Pentazocine belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines). It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain.

When a narcotic medicine is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.


Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of pentazocine injection in children 1 to 16 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 1 year of age.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of pentazocine injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of pentazocine injection than younger adults, and are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving pentazocine injection.
