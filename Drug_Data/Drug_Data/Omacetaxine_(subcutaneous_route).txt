Description:
Omacetaxine injection is used to treat chronic or accelerated phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It is used in patients who have already received medicines for CML that did not work well. Leukemia is a type of cancer where the body makes abnormal white blood cells.

Omacetaxine is an antineoplastic (cancer) medicine. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by omacetaxine, other side effects can occur. Before you begin treatment, talk to your doctor about the benefits of this medicine as well as the possible risks of using it.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.

Omacetaxine can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

-> If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
-> Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
-> Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
-> Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
-> Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
