Description:
Dolasetron injection is used to prevent and treat nausea and vomiting that may happen after surgery.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.


Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of dolasetron injection to prevent and treat nausea and vomiting that occurred after surgery in children 2 years of age and older. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 2 years of age.

Use of dolasetron injection to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by cancer medicines in children is not recommended.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of dolasetron injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have heart rhythm problems (eg, prolonged QT, PR, and QRS interval), which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving dolasetron injection.

Use of dolasetron injection to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by cancer medicines in geriatric patients is not recommended.
