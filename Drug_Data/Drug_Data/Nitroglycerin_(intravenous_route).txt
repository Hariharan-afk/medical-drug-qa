Description:
Nitroglycerin injection is used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) during surgery or to control congestive heart failure in patients who have had a heart attack. It may also be used to produce hypotension (low blood pressure) during surgery. Nitroglycerin injection is sometimes used to treat angina (chest pain) in patients who have been treated with other medicines that did not work well.

Nitroglycerin belongs to the group of medicines called nitrates. It works by relaxing the blood vessels and increasing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its work load.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
