Description:
Insulin human inhaled is a man-made insulin that is breathed in through your lungs and is used to control high blood sugar in patients with diabetes. Insulin is one of many hormones that help the body turn the food we eat into energy. This is done by using the glucose (sugar) in the blood as quick energy. Also, insulin helps us store energy that we can use later. When you have diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes), your body cannot make enough insulin or does not use insulin properly. So, you must take additional insulin to regulate your blood sugar and keep your body healthy. This is very important as too much sugar in the blood can be harmful to your health.

Insulin human starts to work faster than some other types of insulin, and its effects do not last as long. It should act more like the insulin your body would normally produce. Because the effects of insulin human are short-acting, your doctor may also prescribe a longer-acting insulin for you to use.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Aerosol Powder
