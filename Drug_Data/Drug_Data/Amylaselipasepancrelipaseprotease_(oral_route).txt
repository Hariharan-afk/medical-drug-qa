Description:
Pancrelipase is used to treat patients who cannot digest food normally because their pancreas does not make enough enzymes (exocrine pancreatic insufficiency). Pancrelipase  tablet  is used in combination with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) in patients who have long-term swelling of the pancreas (chronic pancreatitis) or who have had some or all of their pancreas removed (pancreatectomy).

Pancrelipase contains a mixture of digestive enzymes (eg, lipases, proteases, and amylases) needed for the digestion of proteins, starches, and fats.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

Swallow the  capsule  or  tablet  whole with enough fluid (eg, water or juice) to prevent irritation of the mouth. Do not crush or chew it.

For patients taking the  tablets :

-> Viokace™ tablet is used in combination with certain medicines for stomach ulcer called proton pump inhibitors (eg, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, Nexium®, Prevacid®, Prilosec®).
-> Swallow the tablets quickly with some liquid, without chewing, to avoid mouth irritation.
For patients taking the  delayed-release capsules :

-> Swallow the capsule whole.
-> Do not crush, break, or chew before swallowing. Do not hold the capsule in your mouth.

Mix the contents evenly. Do not crush the capsule contents while mixing. This mixture must be swallowed immediately and followed with a glass of water or juice. This will ensure complete swallowing of the contents of the capsule and avoid mouth irritation.

Do not mix the contents of the capsule directly into a bottle of breast milk or formula. This could reduce the effect of the medicine.
