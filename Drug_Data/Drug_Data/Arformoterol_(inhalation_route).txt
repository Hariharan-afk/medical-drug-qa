Description:
Arformoterol is used for the long-term maintenance treatment of air flow blockage in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. COPD is a long-term lung disease that causes bronchospasm (wheezing or difficulty with breathing). When used regularly, inhaled arformoterol decreases the number and severity of COPD attacks. However, it will not relieve symptoms of a COPD attack that has already started.

Arformoterol belongs to the family of medicines known as bronchodilators. Bronchodilators are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. They relieve coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air into the lungs.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
