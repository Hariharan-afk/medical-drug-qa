Description:
Dapagliflozin is used together with proper diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes. It works in the kidneys to prevent absorption of glucose (blood sugar). This helps lower the blood sugar level. Dapagliflozin does not help patients who have insulin-dependent or type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetic patients must use insulin injections.

Dapagliflozin is also used to lower the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular (heart or blood vessel) disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors. This medicine is also used to lower the risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalization, and urgent heart failure visit in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (the heart is weak and cannot pump enough blood to the rest of the body).

Dapagliflozin is also used to lower the risk of worsening of kidney disease, end stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic kidney disease.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
