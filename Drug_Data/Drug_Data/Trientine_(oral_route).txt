Description:
Trientine is used to treat Wilson's disease, a disease in which there is high levels of copper in the body in patients who are de-coppered and dependent to penicillamine.

This medicine combines with excess copper in the body and may prevent your body from absorbing the copper in the foods you eat. Removing copper from the body prevents damage to the liver, brain, and other organs. The combination of copper and trientine is then easily removed by the kidneys and it passes from the body in urine.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Capsule
