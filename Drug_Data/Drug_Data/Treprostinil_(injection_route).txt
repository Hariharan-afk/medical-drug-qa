Description:
Treprostinil injection is used to treat the symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension. This is high blood pressure that occurs in the main artery that carries blood from the right side of the heart (the ventricle) to the lungs. When the smaller blood vessels in the lungs become more resistant to blood flow, the right ventricle must work harder to pump enough blood through the lungs.

Treprostinil belongs to the group of agents called prostaglandins, which occur naturally in the body and are involved in many biological functions. Treprostinil works by relaxing blood vessels and increasing the supply of blood to the lungs, which reduces the workload of the heart.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
