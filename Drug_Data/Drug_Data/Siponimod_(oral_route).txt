Symptoms of your MS may return and become worse after stopping treatment with this medicine. Do not stop using this medicine without checking first with your doctor.

Avoid being near people who are sick or have infections while you are using this medicine. Wash your hands often. Also tell your doctor if you have ever had an infection that would not go away or an infection that kept coming back.

Siponimod may cause a rare condition called immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). This may occur after a person stops receiving this medicine after developing PML during treatment. Tell your doctor right away if you have an inflammatory reaction to an infection that includes mild burning, stinging, or tingling of the skin, or a feeling of heat, redness, or swelling of the skin.

Check with your doctor right away if blurred vision, difficulty with reading, or any other change in vision occurs during or after treatment. Your doctor may want your eyes be checked by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor).

Tell your doctor right away if you have a cough, trouble breathing, chest tightness, or any type of breathing problem with this medicine. These could be symptoms of a serious lung problem.

You should not receive a live vaccine during treatment with this medicine and for 4 weeks after the last dose. Do not use this medicine 1 week before and for 4 weeks after receiving a live vaccine. Siponimod may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent.
