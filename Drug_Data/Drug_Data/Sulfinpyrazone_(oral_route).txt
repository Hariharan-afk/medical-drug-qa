Description:
Sulfinpyrazone is used in the treatment of chronic gout (gouty arthritis), which is caused by too much uric acid in the blood. The medicine works by removing the extra uric acid from the body. Sulfinpyrazone does not cure gout, but after you have been taking it for a few months it may help prevent gout attacks. This medicine will help prevent gout attacks only as long as you continue to take it.

Sulfinpyrazone is sometimes used to prevent or treat other medical problems that may occur if too much uric acid is present in the body.

Sulfinpyrazone may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.

Sulfinpyrazone is available only with your doctor's prescription.

Other Medical Problems:
The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

-> Cancer being treated by antineoplastics (cancer medicine) or radiation (x-rays) or

Proper Use:
If sulfinpyrazone upsets your stomach, it may be taken with food. If this does not work, an antacid may be taken. If stomach upset (nausea, vomiting, or stomach pain) continues, check with your doctor.

In order for sulfinpyrazone to help you, it must be taken regularly as ordered by your doctor.

When you first begin taking sulfinpyrazone, the amount of uric acid in the kidneys is greatly increased. This may cause kidney stones in some people. To help prevent this, your doctor may want you to drink at least 10 to 12 full glasses (8 ounces each) of fluids each day, or to take another medicine to make your urine less acid. It is important that you follow your doctor's instructions very carefully.

For patients taking sulfinpyrazone for gout:

-> After you begin to take sulfinpyrazone, gout attacks may continue to occur for a while. However, if you take this medicine regularly as directed by your doctor, the attacks will gradually become less frequent and less painful. After you have been taking sulfinpyrazone for several months, they may stop completely.
-> Sulfinpyrazone helps to prevent gout attacks. It will not relieve an attack that has already started. Even if you take another medicine for gout attacks, continue to take this medicine also.

Dosing:
The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.

The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.

-> For treating gout or removing uric acid from the body: Adults: The starting dose of sulfinpyrazone is usually 100 mg or 200 mg a day (one-half of a 100-mg tablet two times a day, one 100-mg tablet one or two times a day, or one 200-mg capsule or tablet once a day). Then, the dose is usually increased by 100 mg or 200 mg every few days, up to 800 mg a day.
