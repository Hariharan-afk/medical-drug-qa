Description:
Guaifenesin and hydrocodone combination is used to treat cough and to loosen mucus associated with the common cold.

Hydrocodone is an opioid antitussive (cough suppressant). It acts directly on the cough center in the brain to relieve cough. Guaifenesin is used to help clear mucus or phlegm from the chest when you have congestion from a cold or flu. It works by thinning the mucus or phlegm in the lungs.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
The use of hydrocodone in children younger than 6 years of age has caused serious breathing problems, sometimes causing death. Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of guaifenesin and hydrocodone combination in the pediatric population.

Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of guaifenesin and hydrocodone combination in the elderly.
