Description:
Saxagliptin is used with proper diet and exercise to treat high blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Saxagliptin helps to control blood sugar levels by increasing substances in the body that make the pancreas release more insulin. It also signals the liver to stop producing sugar (glucose) when there is too much sugar in the blood. This medicine does not help patients who have insulin-dependent or type 1 diabetes.
