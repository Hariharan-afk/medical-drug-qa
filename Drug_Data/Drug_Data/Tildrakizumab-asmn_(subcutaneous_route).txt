You will need to have a skin test for tuberculosis before you start receiving this medicine. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your home has ever had a positive reaction to a tuberculosis skin test.

This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including angioedema, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, or large, hive-like swelling on the face, eyelids, lips, tongue, throat, hands, legs, feet, or sex organs after receiving this medicine.

Your body's ability to fight infection may be reduced while you are being treated with tildrakizumab-asmn. It is very important that you call your doctor at the first signs of any infection. Check with your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms while using this medicine: fever, chills, cough or hoarseness, flu-like symptoms, lower back or side pain, painful or difficult urination, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

While you are being treated with tildrakizumab-asmn, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Tildrakizumab-asmn may lower your body's resistance and the vaccine may not work as well or you might get the infection the vaccine is meant to prevent. In addition, you should not be around other persons living in your household who receive live virus vaccines because there is a chance they could pass the virus on to you. Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.
