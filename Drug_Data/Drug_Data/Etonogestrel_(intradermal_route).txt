Proper Use:
Nexplanon® is an implant that is surgically placed and removed under the skin of the upper arm by a trained healthcare provider. The implant is placed in the upper arm for 3 years and then removed by the end of the third year.

It is very important that you tell your doctor if you think you might be pregnant or if you missed a period before you receive this medicine . A pregnancy test will be done to make sure you are not pregnant before this medicine is inserted.

This medicine comes with patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.

The implant is usually inserted by your doctor within the first 5 days of your menstrual period.

After this medicine is inserted, your doctor should feel your arm to check that the implant is in the right place. You can also check it by gently pressing your fingertips over the insertion site. You should be able to feel the small rod. If you cannot feel the implant in your arm, you will need to use a non-hormonal birth control (such as condoms, spermicide) until your doctor confirms that the implant is in place.

Your doctor will treat the arm with numbing medicine and insert the implant with a special tool. The incision will be covered with 2 bandages. You may remove the top bandage after 24 hours. Keep the smaller bandage clean and dry and in place for 3 to 5 days.

Your doctor must remove this medicine after 3 years. If you would like to stop using this medicine, your doctor can remove it at any time. Do not try to remove the implant by yourself.

If you still want to prevent pregnancy after this medicine is removed, you should start using another form of birth control (eg, condoms, diaphragms, or spermicides) right away. If you still want to continue using this medicine, your doctor can insert a new implant under your skin after taking the old one out.
