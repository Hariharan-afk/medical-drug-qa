Proper Use:
Your dentist or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a medical facility. It is given through a needle placed into your gum, usually near the underside of your tongue. Before you receive the injection, a numbing gel may be rubbed onto the gum to make the injection more comfortable.

This medicine should cause numbness only to the area where it is injected. You may experience temporary loss of sensation or movement in the injected area. This type of numbing procedure is called local anesthesia. It is not meant to cause you to fall asleep or become unconscious.

Your mouth may be numb for several hours. To avoid injury after dental work, do not eat or drink until normal feeling has returned to the area. Do not test the feeling in your mouth by biting or poking the treated area.


Precautions:
It is very important that your dentist check your or your child's progress closely while receiving this medicine  to see if it is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for any unwanted effects.

This medicine may increase your risk of having serious heart and blood vessel problems such as a heart attack, heart rhythm changes, or low blood pressure.

This medicine may cause a rare, but serious blood problem called methemoglobinemia. The risk may be increased in children younger than 6 months of age, elderly patients, or patients with certain inborn defects.
