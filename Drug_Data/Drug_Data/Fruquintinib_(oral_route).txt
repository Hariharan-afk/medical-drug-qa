Description:
Fruquintinib is used to treat colorectal cancer (cancer of the colon or rectum) that has spread throughout the body in patients who have received other cancer treatments (eg, fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) that did not work well.

Fruquintinib belongs to the group of medicines, called antineoplastics. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by the medicine, other unwanted effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
