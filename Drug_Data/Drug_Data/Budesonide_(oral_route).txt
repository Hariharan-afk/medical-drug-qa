Description:
Budesonide is used to treat mild to moderate active Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease. This medicine works inside the intestines (bowels) to reduce inflammation and symptoms of the disease. It also helps keep the symptoms of Crohn's disease from coming back. Budesonide is a steroid (cortisone-like) medicine.

Budesonide  extended-release tablets  are used to help get active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis under control (induce remission).

Budesonide  delayed-release capsules  are used to reduce levels of protein in the urine (proteinuria) in patients who have a kidney disease called primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), who are at risk of progressing.

Budesonide  oral liquid  is used to treat eosinophilic esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus).

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Suspension
-> Capsule, Extended Release

Before Using:

Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of budesonide  delayed-release capsules  in children 8 to 17 years of age and weighing more than 25 kilograms (kg). However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 8 years of age, or in children 8 to 17 years of age and weighs 25 kg or less. Safety and efficacy have not been established to help keep the symptoms of Crohn's disease from coming back in children. Because budesonide may cause slowed growth in children, those who will be using it for a long time should have their weight and growth measured by the doctor regularly.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of budesonide  extended-release tablets  in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of budesonide in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving budesonide.
