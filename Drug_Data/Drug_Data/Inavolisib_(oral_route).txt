Description:
Inavolisib is used in combination with other medicines (eg, fulvestrant, palbociclib) to treat hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, PIK3CA­mutated, advanced or metastatic (cancer that has spread) breast cancer that has come back after hormonal (endocrine) treatment. Your doctor will test for the presence of the mutation.

Inavolisib interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by the medicine, other unwanted effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.
