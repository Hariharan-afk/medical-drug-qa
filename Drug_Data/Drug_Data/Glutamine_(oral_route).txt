Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:

Pediatric:
Safety and efficacy of glutamine  to treat short bowel syndrome in children  has not been established.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of glutamine  to reduce acute complications of sickle cell disease in children 5 years of age and older.  Safety and efficacy of glutamine  to reduce acute complications of sickle cell anemia in children younger than 5 years of age  has not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of glutamine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving this medicine.
