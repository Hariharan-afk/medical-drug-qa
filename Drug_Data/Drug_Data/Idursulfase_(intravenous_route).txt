Description:
Idursulfase injection is used to treat Hunter syndrome (Mucopolysaccharidosis II, MPS II), a rare condition that is most often seen in males. Hunter syndrome is an inherited disease in which the breakdown of a certain chemical in the body (mucopolysaccharide) is defective due to the lack or absence of an enzyme called iduronate-2-sulfatase.

Idursulfase improves signs and symptoms in patients, especially walking capacity, by replacing the missing enzyme in Hunter syndrome.
