Description:
Vestronidase alfa-vjbk injection is used to treat Mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPS VII) or Sly syndrome.

Sly syndrome is a disorder caused by the lack of an enzyme called beta-glucuronidase (GUS), which causes an abnormal build-up of toxic materials in the cells. Vestronidase alfa-vjbk acts by replacing the GUS enzyme and helps reduce the amount of toxic materials in the blood.
