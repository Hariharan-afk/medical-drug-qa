Description:
Dasatinib is used to treat Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML) in adults and children. It is also used to treat Ph+ CML and Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) in adults after other medicines (eg, imatinib) or treatments did not work well. Dasatinib is also used in combination with chemotherapy to treat newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL in children 1 year of age and older. Leukemia is a type of cancer where the body makes too many abnormal white blood cells. It belongs to the general group of medicines known as antineoplastics or cancer medicines. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body.

Dasatinib can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection.

-> Check with your doctor right away if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
-> Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
-> Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
