Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin

Varizig


Description:
Varicella-zoster immune globulin is used to prevent exposure of varicella virus in high risk individuals, such as adults and children with weakened immune system, pregnant women, premature babies, and babies younger than 1 year of age.

Varicella-zoster immune globulin works by giving your body the antibodies it needs to protect it against varicella-zoster virus (VZV). This is called passive protection. This passive protection lasts long enough to protect your body until your body can produce its own antibodies against VZV.

Varicella (commonly known as chickenpox) is an infection that is easily spread from one person to another. Chickenpox is usually a mild infection but sometimes it can cause serious problems, such as pneumonia, inflammation of the brain, and a rare disease called Reye's syndrome.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor or other health care professional.
