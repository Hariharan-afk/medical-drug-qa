Description:
Mumps Virus Vaccine Live is an active immunizing agent used to prevent infection by the mumps virus. It works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the virus infection.

Mumps is an infection that can cause serious problems, such as encephalitis and meningitis, which affect the brain. In addition, adolescent boys and men are very susceptible to a condition called orchitis, which causes pain and swelling in the testicles and scrotum and, in rare cases, sterility. Also, mumps infection can cause spontaneous abortion in women during the first 3 months of pregnancy.

Immunization against mumps is recommended for all persons 12 months of age or older.

Immunization against mumps is not recommended for infants less than 12 months of age, because antibodies they received from their mothers before birth may interfere with the effectiveness of the vaccine. Children who were immunized against mumps before 12 months of age should be immunized again.

You can be considered to be immune to mumps only if you:

-> received mumps vaccine on or after your first birthday and have the medical record to prove it, or
-> have a doctor's diagnosis of a previous mumps infection, or
-> have had a laboratory test that shows that you are immune to mumps.
This vaccine is to be administered only by or under the supervision of your doctor or other health care professional.

Pediatric:
