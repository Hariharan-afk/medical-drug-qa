Precautions:
It is important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits. This is to make sure the medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.

Check with your doctor before starting any strenuous physical exercise, especially if you are out of condition and are taking any other medication. Exercise and certain medications may increase the amount of potassium in the blood.

-> If you are on a potassium-rich or potassium-restricted diet, check with your health care professional. Potassium citrate–containing medicines contain a large amount of potassium.
For patients taking  sodium citrate–containing medicines :

-> If you are on a sodium-restricted diet, check with your health care professional. Sodium citrate–containing medicines contain a large amount of sodium.
