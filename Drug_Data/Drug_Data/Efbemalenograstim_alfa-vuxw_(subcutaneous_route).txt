Description:
Efbemalenograstim alfa-vuxw injection is used to treat neutropenia (low white blood cells) that is caused by cancer medicines. It is a synthetic (man-made) form of a substance that is naturally produced in your body called a colony stimulating factor. Efbemalenograstim alfa-vuxw helps the bone marrow to make new white blood cells.

When certain cancer medicines are used to fight cancer cells, they also affect the white blood cells that fight infections. Efbemalenograstim alfa-vuxw is used to lower the risk of getting an infection while you are being treated with cancer medicines.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the supervision of a doctor.
