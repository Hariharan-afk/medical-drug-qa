Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines.

For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

Drug Interactions:
Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.


Other Interactions:
Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.  Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.  Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.


Proper Use:
Your doctor will give you this medicine through a needle into your retina (part of the eye). It is to be injected into each eye separately at least 6 days apart.

You may be given an oral steroid medicine before, during, and after treatment with voretigene neparvovec-rzyl in the first eye and to be repeated with treatment of your other eye.
