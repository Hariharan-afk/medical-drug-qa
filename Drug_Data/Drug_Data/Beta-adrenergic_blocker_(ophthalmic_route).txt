Description:
Beta-adrenergic blocking agents for the eye are used to treat certain types of glaucoma. They appear to work by reducing the production of fluid in the eye. This lowers the pressure in the eye.

These medicines are available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Suspension
-> Solution
-> Gel Forming Solution

Before Using:

Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Infants may be especially sensitive to the effects of ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents. This may increase the chance of side effects during treatment.


Geriatric:
Elderly people are especially sensitive to the effects of ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents. If too much medicine is absorbed into the body, the chance of side effects during treatment may be increased.


Pregnancy:
Ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be absorbed into the body. These medicines have not been studied in pregnant women. Studies in animals have not shown that betaxolol, levobunolol, metipranolol, or timolol causes birth defects. However, high doses of levobetaxolol given by mouth to pregnant rabbits have been shown to cause  birth defects in rabbit babies, and very large doses of carteolol given by mouth to pregnant rats have been shown to cause wavy ribs in rat babies. In addition, some studies in animals have shown that beta-adrenergic blocking agents increase the chance of death in the animal fetus. Before using ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents, make sure your doctor knows if you are pregnant or if you may become pregnant.


Breastfeeding:
Betaxolol and timolol, and maybe other beta-adrenergic blocking agents, when taken by mouth, may pass into the breast milk. Since ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be absorbed into the body, they, too, may pass into the breast milk. However, it is not known whether ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents pass into the breast milk, and these medicines have not been reported to cause problems in nursing babies.


Drug Interactions:
Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking any of these medicines, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.

Using medicines in this class with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.

-> Albuterol
-> Ceritinib
-> Clonidine
-> Cobicistat
-> Crizotinib
-> Darunavir
-> Desvenlafaxine
-> Diltiazem

Other Interactions:
Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.  Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.  Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.


Other Medical Problems:
The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of medicines in this class. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

-> Allergic reactions, severe (history of)—Use of an ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agent may reduce the effectiveness of the medicine (epinephrine) used to treat severe allergic reactions.
-> Asthma (or history of),  chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or other lung disease—Severe breathing problems, including death due to bronchospasm (spasm of the bronchial tubes), have been reported in patients with asthma following use of some ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents (carteolol, levobunolol, metipranolol, and timolol). Although most often not a problem, the possibility of wheezing or troubled breathing also exists with betaxolol and levobetaxolol.
-> Type 2 diabetes mellitus or
-> Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)—Ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents may cover up some signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), such as fast heartbeat and trembling, although they do not cover up other signs, such as dizziness or sweating.
-> Heart or blood vessel disease—Ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents may decrease heart activity.
-> Myasthenic conditions—Ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents may worsen muscle weakness caused by diseases such as myasthenia gravis.
-> Overactive thyroid—Ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents may cover up certain signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism  (overactive thyroid). Suddenly stopping the use of ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents may cause a sudden and dangerous increase in thyroid symptoms.

Proper Use:
To use:

-> First, wash your hands. With the middle finger, apply pressure to the inside corner of the eye (and continue to apply pressure for 1 or 2 minutes after the medicine has been placed in the eye). This is especially important if the ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agent is used to treat infants and children. Tilt the head back and with the index finger of the same hand, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to form a pouch. Drop the medicine into the pouch and gently close the eyes. Do not blink. Keep the eyes closed for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed.
-> Immediately after using the eye drops, wash your hands to remove any medicine that may be on them.
-> To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). Also, keep the container tightly closed.
-> If you are using levobunolol with the  compliance cap (C Cap): Before using the eye drops for the first time, make sure the number 1 or the correct day of the week appears in the window on the cap. Remove the cap and use the eye drops as directed. Replace the cap. Holding the cap between your thumb and forefinger, rotate the bottle until the cap clicks to the next position. This will tell you the time of your next dose. After every dose, rotate the bottle until the cap clicks to the position that tells you the time of your next dose.
-> If you are using the gel-forming timolol solution: Before using the eye drops each time, turn the closed bottle upside-down and shake once. If you use other eye drops in addition to the gel-forming solution, the other eye drops should be used first, then wait at least ten minutes before using this medicine.
-> If you wear soft contact lenses and your eye drops contain benzalkonium chloride: Remove your contacts before you use your eye drops. Wait for fifteen minutes after using the eye drops before putting your contacts in your eyes.
-> Before using the eye drops for the first time, make sure the number 1 or the correct day of the week appears in the window on the cap.
-> Remove the cap and use the eye drops as directed.
-> Replace the cap. Holding the cap between your thumb and forefinger, rotate the bottle until the cap clicks to the next position. This will tell you the time of your next dose.
-> After every dose, rotate the bottle until the cap clicks to the position that tells you the time of your next dose.
-> Before using the eye drops each time, turn the closed bottle upside-down and shake once.
-> If you use other eye drops in addition to the gel-forming solution, the other eye drops should be used first, then wait at least ten minutes before using this medicine.
-> Remove your contacts before you use your eye drops. Wait for fifteen minutes after using the eye drops before putting your contacts in your eyes.
Use this medicine only as directed . Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of too much medicine being absorbed into the body and the chance of side effects.
