It is given to patients who have stage 2 to stage 3A NSCLC and whose tumors express PD-L1. Your doctor will perform a test to check for the PD-L1 tumor before you receive this medicine.

Atezolizumab injection is also used alone as first-line treatment for metastatic (cancer that has already spread) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients whose tumors express high PD-L1 and do not have an abnormal EGFR or ALK gene. Your doctor will perform a test to check for the PD-L1 tumor before you receive this medicine. It is used together with other cancer medicines (eg, bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin combination, or paclitaxel protein-bound and carboplatin combination) as first-line treatment to metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer in patients whose tumor does not have an abnormal EGFR or ALK gene. It is also used to treat metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with or without an EGFR or ALK gene in patients who have tried treatment for EGFR or ALK tumors and received cancer medicines containing platinum that did not work well.

Atezolizumab injection is also used together with carboplatin and etoposide as first-line treatment for extensive-stage (cancer that has spread) small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).
