Description:
Mitotane is used to treat cancer of the adrenal glands (adrenocortical carcinoma) that cannot be removed by surgery. This medicine acts on a part of the body called the adrenal cortex. Mitotane reduces the amount of steroids (cortisone-like hormones) that are produced by the adrenal cortex. These hormones are important for various functions of the body, including growth. However, too much of these hormones can cause problems.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.

Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of mitotane in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of mitotane in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving mitotane.
