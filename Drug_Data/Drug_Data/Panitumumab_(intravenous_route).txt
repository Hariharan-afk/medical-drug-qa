Description:
Panitumumab injection is used alone or in combination with other medicines to treat metastatic cancer (cancer that spreads to other parts of the body) of the colon or rectum in patients who have already received other cancer treatments. Panitumumab injection should only be used in patients who have a wild type RAS (in both KRAS and NRAS) gene mutation test. This test helps the doctor decide whether the medicine will treat their cancer.

Panitumumab interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by panitumumab, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, such as a skin rash, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects do not occur until months or years after the medicine is used.

Before you begin treatment with panitumumab, you and your doctor should talk about the benefits of this medicine as well as the risks of using it.

This medicine will only be given by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
