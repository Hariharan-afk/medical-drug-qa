Description:
Aspirin and omeprazole combination is used in patients who need aspirin to prevent heart and blood vessel problems (eg, heart attack, stroke) and who are at risk of developing stomach ulcers caused by aspirin.

Aspirin is a salicylate medicine used to lower the risk of heart attacks in patients with chronic coronary artery disease, such as patients with history of heart attack or angina (severe chest pain). It is also used to lower the risk of recurrent stroke in patients who had an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It works by decreasing the amount of acid produced by the stomach.
