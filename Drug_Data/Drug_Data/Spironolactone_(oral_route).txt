Description:
Spironolactone is used in combination with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and heart failure. Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks. Spironolactone is also used to lessen the need for hospitalization for heart failure.

Spironolactone is also used to diagnose and treat hyperaldosteronism, a condition in which the adrenal gland produces too much hormone called aldosterone. This medicine may also be used to treat fluid retention (edema) in patients with congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, or a kidney disorder called nephrotic syndrome.

Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic (water pill). It prevents your body from absorbing too much salt and keeps your potassium levels from getting too low. This medicine is also used to treat or prevent hypokalemia (low potassium levels in the blood).

This medicine is available only with your doctor’s prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet
-> Suspension

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of spironolactone in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of spironolactone in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution for patients receiving spironolactone.


Breastfeeding:
Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.

Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.


Precautions:
It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits  to make sure this medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to take it. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Do not take this medicine together with eplerenone (Inspra®) . Using these medicines together may cause serious unwanted effects.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This especially includes potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium, certain diuretics (eg, amiloride, triamterene (Dyazide®, Dyrenium®, Maxzide®, Midamor®, Moduretic®), or other products containing spironolactone (Aldactazide®) .

Hyperkalemia (high potassium in the blood) may occur while you are using this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have the following symptoms: stomach pain, confusion, difficulty with breathing, irregular heartbeat, nausea or vomiting, nervousness, numbness or tingling in the hands, feet, or lips, or weakness or heaviness of the legs. Ask your doctor before you use any medicine, supplement, or salt substitute that contains potassium.

Spironolactone may worsen kidney function in patients with low to no salt in their body or in those who take other blood pressure medicines (eg, ARB, ACE inhibitor). Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this.

Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may also occur, especially when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you . If you feel dizzy, lie down so you do not faint. Then sit for a few moments before standing to prevent the dizziness from returning.

This medicine may also cause electrolyte imbalances (including low sodium, magnesium, and calcium in the blood, hypochloremic alkalosis) and an increase in your uric acid and blood sugar levels. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns.

Check with your doctor right away if you become sick while taking this medicine, especially if you have severe or continuing nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that does not stop. These conditions may cause you to lose too much water or salt and may lead to low blood pressure. You can also lose water by sweating, so drink plenty of water during exercise or in hot weather.

This medicine may cause swelling of the breasts (gynecomastia) and breast pain in some patients. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.
