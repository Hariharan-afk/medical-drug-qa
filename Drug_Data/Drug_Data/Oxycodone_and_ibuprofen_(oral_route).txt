Description:
Ibuprofen and oxycodone combination is used to relieve acute, moderate to severe pain.

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used to relieve inflammation, swelling, and pain. Oxycodone is an opioid analgesic that acts in the central nervous system to relieve pain. If oxycodone is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming (causing mental or physical dependence). Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking the medicine. Since ibuprofen and oxycodone combination is only used for short-term (7 days or less) relief of pain, physical dependence probably will not occur.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of ibuprofen and oxycodone combination in children younger than 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of oxycodone and ibuprofen combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients who may be more sensitive than younger adults to the effects of ibuprofen and oxycodone combination, are more likely to have kidney, lung, or stomach problems, which may require caution in patients receiving oxycodone and ibuprofen combination.

Precautions:

Do not use more of this medicine or take it more often than your doctor tells you to. This can be life-threatening. Your doctor may prescribe naloxone to treat an overdose. Naloxone is a medicine that temporarily reverses the effects of an overdose. If you have been prescribed naloxone, make sure household members know how to use this on you in the event of an overdose or suspected overdose. Emergency medical attention is still needed after naloxone is used because the reversal effects are only temporary. Symptoms of an overdose include extreme dizziness or weakness, slow heartbeat or breathing, seizures, trouble breathing, and cold, clammy skin. Call your doctor right away if you notice these symptoms .

Using this medicine while you are pregnant may cause neonatal withdrawal syndrome in your newborn babies. Tell your doctor right away if your baby has an abnormal sleep pattern, diarrhea, a high-pitched cry, irritability, shakiness or tremors, weight loss, vomiting, or fails to gain weight.

This medicine may be present in breast milk and passed to your baby. Talk to your doctor if you plan to breastfeed or have questions about how this medicine may affect your baby.

This medicine may increase your risk of having a heart attack or stroke. This is more likely to occur in people who already have heart disease. People who use this medicine for a long time might also have a higher risk. Some signs of serious heart problems are chest pain, tightness in the chest, fast or irregular heartbeat, or unusual flushing or warmth of the skin. Check with your doctor right away if you notice any of these warning signs.

Ibuprofen and oxycodone combination will add to the effects of alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (medicines that make you drowsy or less alert). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicines for hay fever, allergies, or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, sleeping medicine, or other prescription pain medicine or opioids, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. Do not drink alcoholic beverages, and check with your medical doctor or dentist before taking any of the medicines listed above, while you are using this medicine .

This medicine may cause bleeding in your stomach or intestines. This is more likely to occur if you have had a stomach ulcer in the past, if you smoke or drink alcohol regularly, are over 60 years of age, are in poor health, or are using certain other medicines (such as steroids or a blood thinner). These problems can occur at any time with or without warning, and can be fatal. You should contact your doctor immediately  if any of the following symptoms occur including black, tarry stools, bloody stools, vomiting of blood or material that looks like coffee grounds, severe or continuing stomach pain, cramping, or burning, trouble breathing, severe or continuing nausea, heartburn and/or indigestion.

Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.

This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, or certain skin conditions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome). These reactions can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, fever or chills, trouble breathing or swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, mouth, or throat while you are using this medicine.

This medicine may cause some people to become drowsy, dizzy, lightheaded, or to feel a false sense of well-being. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or are not alert and clearheaded . If these reactions are especially bothersome, check with your doctor.

Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur, especially when getting up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may lessen this problem.

Before having any kind of surgery (including dental surgery) or emergency treatment, tell the medical doctor or dentist in charge that you are taking this medicine.

Ibuprofen and oxycodone combination may cause dryness of the mouth. For temporary relief, use sugarless candy or gum, melt bits of ice in your mouth, or use a saliva substitute. However, if dry mouth continues for more than 2 weeks, check with your dentist. Continuing dryness of the mouth may increase the chance of dental disease, including tooth decay, gum disease, and fungus infections.

Call your doctor right away if you have confusion, drowsiness, fever, a general feeling of illness, a headache, loss of appetite, nausea, a stiff neck or back, or vomiting. These could be symptoms of a serious condition called aseptic meningitis.

If you have heart disease or congestive heart failure (CHF), tell your doctor if you have unexplained weight gain or edema (fluid retention or body swelling) with this medicine.

Check with your doctor right away if you have anxiety, restlessness, a fast heartbeat, fever, sweating, muscle spasms, twitching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or see or hear things that are not there. These may be symptoms of a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. Your risk may be higher if you also take certain other medicines that affect serotonin levels in your body.

Using too much of this medicine may cause infertility (unable to have children). Talk with your doctor before using this medicine if you plan to have children.
