Thioplex


Description:
Thiotepa injection is used to lower risk of graft rejection when used with other medicines (eg, high-dose busulfan, cyclophosphamide) as a preparative regimen for stem cell transplantation in children with class 3 beta-thalassemia. It is also used to treat cancer of the breast, ovary, and urinary bladder. This medicine is also used to treat malignant effusions (accumulation of fluid in the body cavity) caused by cancer.

Thiotepa belongs to the group of medicines called alkylating agents. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by thiotepa, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, like hair loss, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects do not occur for months or years after the medicine is used.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of thiotepa injection in children with class 3 beta-thalassemia. However, safety and efficacy of thiotepa injection to treat malignant effusions, breast, ovary, and urinary bladder cancer in children have not been established in children.

Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of thiotepa injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving thiotepa injection.
