Description:
Dabigatran is used to decrease the risk of stroke and blood clots in patients with a serious heart rhythm problem called nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Dabigatran is also used to treat and prevent blood clots (eg, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) from occurring again in patients who already have received other medicines. It is also used to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after hip replacement surgery. It works by preventing harmful clots from forming in the blood vessels.

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of dabigatran  capsules  or  oral pellets  in children with heart rhythm problems or who had hip replacement surgery. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of  dabigatran capsules in children 8 years of age and older  or  dabigatran oral pellets in children younger than 12 years of age  with blood clotting problems. Safety and efficacy have been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of dabigatran in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related stroke, bleeding, or kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving dabigatran.
