Description:
Gadoteridol injection is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent used to help create a clear picture of the body during an MRI scan. MRI scans use magnets and computers to create images of certain areas of the body. Unlike x-rays, MRI scans do not involve radiation. Gadoteridol is a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) that is given by injection before an MRI to help diagnose problems in the brain, spine, head, or neck.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.
