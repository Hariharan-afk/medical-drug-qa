Description:
Belladonna and opium suppositories are used to relieve moderate to severe pain caused by ureteral spasm. This medicine belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines).

When a narcotic is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
