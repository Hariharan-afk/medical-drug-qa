Description:
Niacin and lovastatin combination is used together with a proper diet to help lower cholesterol and triglyceride (fat) levels in the blood. This medicine may help prevent medical problems (eg, heart attacks, stroke) that are caused by fat clogging the blood vessels.

Niacin and lovastatin combination medicine is a combination of two drugs that work together to lower cholesterol and lipid (fat) disorders. Niacin is vitamin B3, which reduces the amount of cholesterol in the blood. Lovastatin belongs to the group of medicines called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins. It works to reduce the amount of cholesterol in the blood by blocking an enzyme that is needed to make cholesterol.

This medicine was available only with your doctor's prescription. The Advicor(R) product will no longer be marketed in the United States as of April 18, 2016.
