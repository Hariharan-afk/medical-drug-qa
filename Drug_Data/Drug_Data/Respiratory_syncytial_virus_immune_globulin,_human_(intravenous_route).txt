Description:
Respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin intravenous (RSV-IGIV) belongs to a group of medicines known as immunizing agents. RSV-IGIV is used to prevent infection caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV-IGIV works by giving your body the antibodies it needs to protect it against RSV infection.

RSV infection can cause serious problems, such as pneumonia and bronchitis, which affect the lungs; and in severe cases, even death. These problems are more likely to occur in infants and young children less than 6 months of age with chronic lung disease, those born with heart problems, and those with a history of premature birth.

Onset of RSV activity usually occurs in November and continues through April or early May, with peak activity occurring from late January through mid-February. A good way to help prevent RSV infection is to get RSV-IGIV before the start of the RSV season.

RSV-IGIV is used to prevent serious lower respiratory tract infection caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children less than 24 months of age with breathing problems or a history of premature birth.

RSV-IGIV is to be administered only by or under the supervision of your doctor or other health care professional.
