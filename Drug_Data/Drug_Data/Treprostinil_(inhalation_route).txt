Tyvaso DPI


Description:
Treprostinil inhalation is used to treat the symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and pulmonary hypertension with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD) to improve exercise ability. PAH is the high blood pressure that occurs in the main artery that carries blood from the right side of the heart (the ventricle) to the lungs. When the smaller blood vessels in the lungs become more resistant to blood flow, the right ventricle must work harder to pump enough blood through the lungs. Treprostinil works by blocking a hormone (a naturally occurring substance), that is found in the blood and lungs in large quantities of the people with pulmonary arterial hypertension.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Powder
-> Solution
