Description:
Aromatic ammonia spirit is used to prevent or treat fainting.

Fainting may be caused by some kinds of medicine, by an unpleasant or stressful event, or by a serious medical problem, such as heart disease. Fainting in an older person is often more serious than fainting in a younger person. Older people and people with a history of heart problems should seek medical attention as soon as possible after fainting.

Aromatic ammonia spirit is available without a doctor's prescription.
