Description:
Lapatinib is used in combination with capecitabine to treat advanced or metastatic (cancer that has already spread) HER2-receptor positive breast cancer in patients who have received other cancer treatments (eg, anthracycline, taxane, trastuzumab) that did not work well.

Lapatinib is also used together with letrozole to treat postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor positive and HER2-receptor positive metastatic breast cancer.

Lapatinib belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics (cancer medicines). It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by the medicine, other unwanted effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
