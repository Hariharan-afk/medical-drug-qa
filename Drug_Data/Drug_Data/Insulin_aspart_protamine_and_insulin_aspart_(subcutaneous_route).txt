Description:
Insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart is a combination of a fast-acting insulin and an intermediate-acting type of human insulin. Insulin is used by people with diabetes to help keep blood sugar levels under control. When you have diabetes mellitus, your body cannot make enough or does not use insulin properly. So, you must take additional insulin to regulate your blood sugar and keep your body healthy. This is very important as too much sugar in your blood can be harmful to your health.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

Always double-check both the concentration (strength) of your insulin  and  your dose.  Concentration and dose are not the same.  The dose is how many units of insulin you will use. The concentration tells how many units of insulin are in each milliliter (mL), such as 100 units/mL (U-100), but this does not mean you will use 100 units at a time.

Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) may occur if you do not take enough or skip a dose of your medicine, changes in insulin regimen, overeat or do not follow your meal plan, have a fever or infection, or do not exercise as much as usual.
