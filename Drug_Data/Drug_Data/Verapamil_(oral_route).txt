Description:
Verapamil is used alone or together with other medicines to treat heart rhythm problems, severe chest pain (angina), or high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled .

Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker. It works by affecting the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. As a result, verapamil relaxes blood vessels and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its workload .

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription .

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet
-> Tablet, Extended Release
-> Capsule, Extended Release

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatrics-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of verapamil in the elderly.
