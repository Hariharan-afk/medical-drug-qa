Description:
Methadone injection is used to relieve severe and persistent pain that requires daily opioid treatment and when other pain medicines did not work well enough or cannot be tolerated. This medicine should not be used to treat pain that you only have once in a while or "as needed". Methadone injection is also used together with medical supervision and counseling to treat opioid addiction (eg, heroin or other morphine-like drugs) in patients who cannot take oral medicines.

Methadone is an opioid analgesic (pain medicine). It acts on the nervous system to relieve pain.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines.

This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants. CNS depressants are medicines that slow down the nervous system, which may cause drowsiness or make you less alert. Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, other prescription pain medicine or opioids, medicine for anxiety or benzodiazepines, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics (numbing medicines), including some dental anesthetics.

This can be life-threatening.Symptoms of an overdose include  extreme dizziness or weakness, trouble breathing, slow heartbeat, seizures, and cold, clammy skin. Call your doctor right away if you notice these symptoms. Your doctor may also give naloxone to treat an overdose. Naloxone is a medicine that temporarily reverses the effects of an overdose. If you have been prescribed naloxone, make sure household members know how to use this on you in the event of an overdose or suspected overdose. Emergency medical attention is still needed after naloxone is used because the reversal effects are only temporary.

Check with your doctor right away if you have anxiety, restlessness, a fast heartbeat, fever, sweating, muscle spasms, twitching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or see or hear things that are not there. These may be symptoms of a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. Your risk may be higher if you also take certain other medicines that affect serotonin levels in your body.
