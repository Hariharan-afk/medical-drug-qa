If you are using the  delayed-release tablets :

It should be taken as soon as you get out of bed in the morning at least 30 minutes before any food, beverage, or other medicines . Food and beverages (eg, mineral water, coffee, tea, or juice) will decrease the amount of risedronate absorbed by the body. Waiting longer than 30 minutes will allow more of the drug to be absorbed. Medicines such as antacids that contain calcium or calcium supplements also will decrease the absorption of risedronate.

Swallow the regular tablet whole . Do not suck or chew on the tablet because it may cause throat irritation.

Do not lie down for 30 minutes after taking risedronate. This will help risedronate reach your stomach faster. It also will help prevent irritation to your esophagus.

However, do not take any food, beverages, or calcium supplements within 30 minutes or longer after taking risedronate. To do so may keep this medicine from working properly.
