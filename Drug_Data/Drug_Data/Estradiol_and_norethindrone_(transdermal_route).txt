Description:
Estradiol and norethindrone skin patch is used to treat moderate to severe hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause. It is also used to treat changes in and around the vagina (such as vaginal dryness, itching, and burning) caused by low estrogen levels or menopause. This medicine is also used to treat certain conditions in women before menopause if their ovaries do not make enough estrogens naturally.

This medicine is a combination of two hormones: an estrogen hormone (estradiol) and a progestin hormone (norethindrone). These hormones are absorbed through your skin into your body. It works by preventing symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating (hot flashes) in women during menopause.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Patch, Extended Release

This medicine comes with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

Before starting CombiPatch® therapy, you may need to tell your doctor if you are currently using continuous estrogen or combination estrogen plus progestin therapy. This will allow your doctor to determine when to start your treatment.

You may have monthly bleeding or spotting at the completion of each cycle.

This transdermal patch system is to be applied on the skin of the lower abdomen (lower stomach area) two times a week, depending on your dosing regimen (either continuous combined regimen or continuous sequential regimen), as advised by your doctor.

To use the  skin patch :

-> Wash your hands with soap and water before and after you use this medicine.
-> Carefully tear open the pouch when you are ready to put the patch on your skin. Do not cut it.
-> Peel off the backing from the patch and apply the patch to a clean, dry, and hair-free area of the lower stomach. This area must be free of powder, oil, or lotion for the patch to stick on to your skin.
-> Press the patch firmly in place with your hand for about 10 seconds.
-> Do not apply the patch on the breast or over any skin folds. Do not apply the patch on oily, broken, burned, or irritated skin, or areas with skin conditions (such as birth marks, tattoos). Avoid applying the patch on the waistline or other places where tight clothing may rub it off.
-> Wear the patch at all times until it is time to put on a new patch. Do not expose it to the sun for long periods of time.
-> When replacing your patch, make sure to apply the new patch to a different area of your lower abdomen. Wait at least 1 week before applying a patch to the same area.
-> When changing a patch, slowly peel it off from your skin. If you have any patch adhesive left on your skin, allow it to dry for 15 minutes and gently rub the sticky area with oil or lotion to remove it. It is best to change your patch on the same days of each week to help you remember.
-> You may take a bath, shower, or swim while using this medicine. Doing so will not affect the patch.
-> If a patch falls off, just put it back on a different area. If the patch does not stick completely, put on a new patch but continue to follow your original schedule for changing your patch.
-> To throw away a used patch: Fold the patch in half with the sticky side together and place it in a sturdy child-proof container. Throw this container in the trash away from children and pets. Do not flush the patch down the toilet.

The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.
