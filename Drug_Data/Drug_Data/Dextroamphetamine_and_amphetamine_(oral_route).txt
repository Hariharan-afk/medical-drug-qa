Description:
Amphetamine and dextroamphetamine combination is used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy (uncontrollable desire for sleep or sudden attacks of deep sleep). These two medicines belong to the group of medicines called central nervous system (CNS) stimulants.

Amphetamine and dextroamphetamine combination works in the treatment of ADHD to increase attention and decrease restlessness in patients who are overactive, cannot concentrate, or are easily distracted. It is used as part of a total treatment program that also includes social, educational, and psychological therapy.

This medicine is available only with a doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Capsule, Extended Release
