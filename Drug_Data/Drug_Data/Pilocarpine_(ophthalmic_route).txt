To use the eye drops:

-> Wash your hands with soap and water before and after using this medicine.
-> Tilt your head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Drop the medicine into this space.
-> Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eye. Do not blink. Keep the eye closed for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed by the eye.
-> If you think you did not get the drop of medicine into your eye properly, repeat the process with another drop.

To use the eye gel:

-> First, wash your hands. Tilt the head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Squeeze a thin strip of gel into this space. A 1½-cm (approximately ½-inch) strip of gel is usually enough, unless you have been told by your doctor to use a different amount. Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eyes. Keep the eyes closed for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed by the eye.
-> Immediately after using the eye gel, wash your hands to remove any medicine that may be on them.
