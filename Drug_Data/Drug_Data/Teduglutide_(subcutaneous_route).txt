Proper Use:
A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine. It is given as a shot under your skin, usually in the arms, stomach, or thighs. You or your caregiver may also be trained to prepare and inject this medicine at home. Be sure that you understand how to use the medicine.

Your doctor may want you to have certain blood tests and imaging procedures of your colon and bowel done within 6 months before starting treatment, at the end of 1 year of treatment, and at least every 5 years to check for polyps.

This medicine should come with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.

If you use this medicine at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems from the injections. Do not inject into skin areas that are tender, bruised, red, or hard.

To prepare the medicine using 1 vial and 1 syringe:

-> Hold the diluent syringe by the barrel. Snap off the white cap. Only the top portion of the white cap should be snapped off. Throw the cap away.
-> Push the open end of the needle onto the end of the diluent syringe. Twist the needle clockwise until it stops turning.
-> Remove the green cap from the vial and throw it away. Find the gray rubber seal on top of the vial. Wipe the rubber seal of the vial with an alcohol swab pad to clean it.
-> Remove the plastic cap from the diluent syringe. Hold the vial between your thumb and index finger. Push the needle down though the center of the gray rubber seal. Slowly push down on the plunger of the diluent syringe. Leave the needle and the diluent syringe in place.
-> Gently tap the barrel of the syringe to make sure all diluent has gone into the vial. Remove the syringe from the vial. Let the vial sit for about 30 seconds. Do not put the needle cap back on.
-> Gently roll the vial between the palms of your hands for about 15 seconds. Do not shake the vial. Let it sit for about 2 minutes.
-> After 2 minutes, check the liquid in the vial. It should be clear and colorless to pale yellow, and should not have any particles in it. If there is any powder in the vial that did not dissolve, gently roll the vial for another 15 seconds.
-> Remove the plastic dosing syringe from the package. Carefully pull back on the plunger to the line that matches the dose prescribed by your doctor.
-> Use one hand to hold the vial. Using your other hand, insert the needle straight down into the middle of the gray rubber seal. Gently push down the plunger until all of the air is gone. Turn the vial and syringe upside down.
-> Hold the vial with one hand. Slowly pull back the plunger of the syringe with your other hand. If there are air bubbles, gently tap the side of the syringe so the bubbles rise to the top.
-> Slowly push the plunger up until all air bubbles are out of the syringe. Make sure the tip of the needle is in the fluid in the vial. Slowly pull back the plunger again to draw up the right dose and check for air bubbles. Once there are no more air bubbles, remove the syringe from the vial. Be careful not to touch the needle.
-> Clean the skin with an alcohol swab pad. Gently pinch the skin. Insert the needle into the skin at a 45 degree angle with a quick, "dart-like" motion. Slowly push down the plunger until the syringe is empty.
