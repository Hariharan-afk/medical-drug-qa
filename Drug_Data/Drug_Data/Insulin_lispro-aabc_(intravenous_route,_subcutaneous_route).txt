Description:
Insulin lispro-aabc, recombinant injection is a fast-acting insulin. Insulin is used by people with diabetes to help keep blood sugar levels under control. When you have diabetes mellitus, your body cannot make enough or does not use insulin properly. So, you must take additional insulin to regulate your blood sugar and keep your body healthy. This is very important as too much sugar in your blood can be harmful to your health.

Insulin lispro-aabc starts to work faster than some other types of insulin, and its effects do not last as long. It should act more like the insulin your body would normally produce. Because the effects of insulin lispro are short-acting, your doctor may also prescribe a longer-acting insulin for you to use.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Solution

Proper Use:
A nurse or other trained health professional may give you this medicine. You may also be taught how to give your medicine at home. This medicine is given as a shot under your skin (eg, stomach, thigh, buttocks, or upper arm) or into a vein.

Always check the label before use, to make sure you have the correct type of insulin. Do not change the brand, type, or concentration unless your doctor tells you to. If you use a pump or other device, make sure the insulin is made for that device.

Always double-check both the concentration (strength) of your insulin  and  your dose.  Concentration and dose are not the same . The dose is how many units of insulin you will use. The concentration tells how many units of insulin are in each milliliter (mL), such as 100 units/mL (U-100), but this does not mean you will use 100 units at a time.

Each package of Lyumjev™ contains a patient information leaflet and patient instructions. Read this leaflet carefully and make sure you understand:

-> How to prepare the medicine.
-> How to inject the medicine.
-> How to use a disposable insulin delivery device.
-> How to use an external insulin pump.
-> How and when to change the infusion set, cartridge adapter, and insulin in the external insulin pump reservoir.
-> How to dispose of syringes, needles, and injection devices.
If you use this medicine at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. Do not use the exact same spot for each injection .

Do not inject into skin areas that are tender, bruised, scaly, hard, damaged, thick, or has pits, lumps, or scars.

When used as a mealtime insulin, it should be taken at the start of a meal or within 20 minutes after you start a meal.

To use the KwikPen®, Tempo Pen™, or Junior KwikPen® :

-> Wash your hands with soap and water.
-> Prime the pen by removing the air from the needle and cartridge. Select 2 units when turning the dose knob.
-> Hold the pen with the needle pointing up, then gently tap the cartridge holder to collect the air bubbles at the top.
-> Push the dose knob until it stops. You should see a "0" in the dose window. Hold the dose knob in and slowly count to 5.
-> You should see insulin at the needle tip. If you do not see insulin, repeat the priming steps but not more than 4 times. If there is still no insulin, change the needle then repeat the priming steps.
-> If your dose is more than 60 units (30 units for Junior KwikPen®), you will need to give more than 1 injection. Use a new needle for each injection and repeat the priming steps.
-> When taking your dose, turn the dose knob to select the number of units you need to inject. The pen dials 1 unit (0.5 unit for Junior KwikPen®) at a time and the dose knob clicks as you turn it. Do not dial your dose by counting the clicks as this can lead to you getting too much or too little insulin.
-> Insert the needle into your skin and push the knob all the way in. Continue to hold it, then slowly count to 5 before removing it.
-> If you see "0" in the dose window, you have received the full dose. Do not redial if you do not see a "0". Reinsert the needle into your skin and finish the injection.
-> If you need 2 injections for a full dose, be sure to take the second injection.
-> Use a new needle each time you give yourself an injection. Always remove and throw the needle after each injection. Store the pen without a needle attached. Do not use the pen if it is broken or damaged.
To use the vial :

-> Wash your hands with soap and water.
-> Use only syringes that are made for insulin injections. Use a new syringe and needle each time you give yourself an injection.
-> Do not mix this medicine with any other insulin.
-> When used in an insulin pump: Carefully read and follow the external insulin pump instructions. This insulin should not be mixed with any other insulin or diluted when used in an insulin pump. The insulin lispro-aabc in the pump should be changed at least every 9 days or any time that the insulin is over 98.6°F (37°C). If you do not understand how you are to use the insulin pump, contact your doctor or pharmacist.

Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using this medicine.

Too much insulin lispro-aabc can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Low blood sugar can also occur if you use insulin lispro-aabc with another antidiabetic medicine, changes in insulin regimen (eg, insulin strength, type of insulin, injection site), delay or miss a meal or snack, exercise more than usual, drink alcohol, or cannot eat because of nausea or vomiting or have diarrhea. Symptoms of low blood sugar must be treated before they lead to unconsciousness (passing out) . Different people may feel different symptoms of low blood sugar. It is important that you learn which symptoms of low blood sugar you usually have so that you can treat it quickly.

Symptoms of low blood sugar  include anxiety, behavior change similar to being drunk, blurred vision, cold sweats, confusion, depression, difficulty in thinking, dizziness or lightheadedness, drowsiness, excessive hunger, fast heartbeat, headache, irritability or abnormal behavior, nervousness, nightmares, restless sleep, shakiness, slurred speech, and tingling in the hands, feet, lips, or tongue.

If symptoms of low blood sugar occur, eat glucose tablets or gel, corn syrup, honey, or sugar cubes, or drink fruit juice, non-diet soft drink, or sugar dissolved in water to relieve the symptoms. Also, check your blood for low blood sugar. Get to a doctor or a hospital right away if the symptoms do not improve. Someone should call for emergency help immediately if severe symptoms such as convulsions (seizures) or unconsciousness occur. Have a glucagon kit available, along with a syringe and needle, and know how to use it. Members of your household should also know how to use it.

Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) may occur if you do not take enough or skip a dose of your antidiabetic medicine or insulin, changes in insulin regimen, you overeat or do not follow your meal plan, have a fever or infection, or do not exercise as much as usual.

Symptoms of high blood sugar  include blurred vision, drowsiness, dry mouth, flushed, dry skin, fruit-like breath odor, increased urination, ketones in the urine, loss of appetite, stomachache, nausea or vomiting, tiredness, trouble breathing (rapid and deep), unconsciousness, and unusual thirst.

If symptoms of high blood sugar occur, check your blood sugar level and then call your doctor for instructions.
