Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of fenoprofen in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.
