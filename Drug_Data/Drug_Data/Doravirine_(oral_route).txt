Description:
Doravirine is used with other anti-HIV medicines to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in patients who have not received HIV-1 medicines before, or in patients to replace their current HIV-1 medicines who have met certain doctor's requirements. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

This medicine does not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS. It helps keep HIV from reproducing and appears to slow down the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay the development of problems that usually result from AIDS or HIV disease. It will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have other problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet
