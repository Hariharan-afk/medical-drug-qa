Description:
Gadoxetate injection is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent used to help create a clear picture of the body during MRI scans. MRI scans use magnets and computers to create images or “pictures” of certain areas of the body. Unlike x-rays, MRI scans do not involve radiation. Gadoxetate is a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) that is given by injection before an MRI to help diagnose problems in the liver.

This medicine is to be used only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.
