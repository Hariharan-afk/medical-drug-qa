Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of  Asacol®  and  Delzicol®  for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in children 5 years of age and older. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 5 years of age and for the prevention of ulcerative colitis in children.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of  Lialda®  for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in children 5 years of age and older weighing 24 kilograms (kg) or more. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 5 years of age, weighing less than 24 kg, or for the prevention of ulcerative colitis in children.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of  Apriso® ,  Asacol® HD , or  Pentasa®  in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of mesalamine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have blood problems (eg, agranulocytosis, neutropenia, pancytopenia) and age-related kidney, liver, or heart disease, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving mesalamine.

Precautions:

Asacol® delayed-release tablet  and Pentasa® extended-release capsule  may cause serious kidney problems, including kidney stones. Check with your doctor right away if you have lower back or side pain, decreased frequency or amount of urine, bloody urine, increased thirst, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, unusual tiredness or weakness, swelling of the face, fingers, or lower legs, weight gain, or trouble breathing.

Check with your doctor right away if you have stomach pain, bloody diarrhea, cramps, fever, headache, or a rash while you are using this medicine. These may be symptoms of a condition called mesalamine-induced acute intolerance syndrome.

Call your doctor right away if you have difficulty breathing or swallowing, a fast heartbeat, itching, rash, or skin redness, or swelling of the face, throat, or tongue. These may be symptoms of an allergic reaction to this medicine.
