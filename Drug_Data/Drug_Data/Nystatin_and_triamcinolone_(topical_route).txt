Description:
Nystatin and triamcinolone combination contains an antifungal and a corticosteroid (cortisone-like medicine).

Antifungals are used to treat infections caused by a fungus. They work by killing the fungus or preventing its growth. This medicine will not work for other kinds of infections. Corticosteroids belong to the family of medicines called steroids. They are used to help relieve redness, swelling, itching, and other discomfort of many skin problems.

This medicine is used to treat certain fungus infections, such as Candida (Monilia), and to help relieve the discomfort of the infection.

Topical corticosteroids may rarely cause some serious side effects. Some of the side effects may be more likely to occur in children. Before using this medicine in children, be sure to talk to your doctor about these problems, as well as the good this medicine may do.

Nystatin and triamcinolone combination is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Cream
