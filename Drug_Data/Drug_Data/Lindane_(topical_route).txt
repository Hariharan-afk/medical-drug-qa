Proper Use:
Lindane is poisonous. Keep it away from the mouth because it is harmful and may be fatal if swallowed.

Use lindane only as directed by your doctor. Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of absorption through the skin and the chance of lindane poisoning.

Keep lindane away from the eyes. If you should accidentally get some in your eyes, flush them thoroughly with water at once and contact your doctor.

Do not use lindane on open wounds, such as cuts or sores on the skin or scalp. To do so may increase the chance of lindane poisoning.

When applying lindane to another person, you should wear plastic disposable or rubber gloves made of latex or vinyl, especially if you are pregnant or are breast-feeding. Do not use natural latex gloves because lindane can go through those gloves and be absorbed by your skin. Wash hands very well after applying the lotion. This will prevent lindane from being absorbed through your skin. If you have any questions about this, check with your healthcare professional.

Put lindane lotion under fingernails, and trim fingernails short. Use a toothbrush to get the lindane lotion under fingernails, and throw out the toothbrush when finished.

Do not cover the area completely. Use a light clothing.

Lindane comes with patient directions. Be sure that you read them very carefully before using lindane. If you have any questions check with your healthcare professional.

Your sexual partner or partners, especially, and all members of your household may need to be treated also, since the infestation may spread to persons in close contact. If these persons have not been checked for an infestation or if you have any questions about this, check with your healthcare professional
