Description:
Ertugliflozin and sitagliptin combination is used with proper diet and exercise to treat high blood sugar levels caused by type 2 diabetes.

Ertugliflozin works in the kidneys to prevent absorption of glucose (blood sugar). This helps lower the blood sugar level. Sitagliptin helps to control blood sugar levels by increasing substances in the body that make the pancreas release more insulin. It also signals the liver to stop producing sugar (glucose) when there is too much sugar in the blood. This medicine does not help patients who have insulin-dependent or type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetic patients must use insulin injections.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
