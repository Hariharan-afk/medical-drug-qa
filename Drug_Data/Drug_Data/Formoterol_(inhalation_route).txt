Perforomist


Description:
Formoterol is used together with other medicines (eg, inhaled corticosteroids) to treat asthma and prevent bronchospasm in patients with asthma. When used regularly every day, inhaled formoterol decreases the number and severity of asthma attacks. However, it will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.

Formoterol is also used for the long-term maintenance treatment of air flow blockage in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. COPD is a long-term lung disease that causes bronchospasm (wheezing or difficulty with breathing).

Formoterol belongs to the family of medicines known as bronchodilators. Bronchodilators are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. They relieve cough, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.

Formoterol is also used to prevent troubled breathing or wheezing caused by exercise (exercise-induced bronchospasm or EIB).

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Solution
