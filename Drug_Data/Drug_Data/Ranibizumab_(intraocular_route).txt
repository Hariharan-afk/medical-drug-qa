Description:
Ranibizumab is used to treat neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD). It is also used in diabetic patients who have diabetic macular edema (DME).  Susvimo®  is used in patients who have responded to at least 2 injections of a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor. AMD is a disorder of the retina in the eye that causes blurring of vision or blindness. Ranibizumab works by changing the amount of blood that gets to the eye.

Ranibizumab is also used to treat myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV).

Ranibizumab is used to treat macular edema (swelling of the back of the eye) after retinal vein occlusion (a blood vessel in the eye is blocked). Macular edema can cause loss of vision. This medicine is also used to treat diabetic retinopathy (eye problem caused by diabetes).

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
