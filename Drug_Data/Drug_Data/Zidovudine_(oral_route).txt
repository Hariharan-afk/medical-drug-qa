Description:
Zidovudine (also known as AZT) is used together with other medicines for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Zidovudine is used to slow the progression of disease in patients infected with HIV who have advanced symptoms, early symptoms, or no symptoms at all. This medicine is also used to help prevent pregnant women who have HIV from passing the virus to their babies during pregnancy and at birth.

Zidovudine will not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS. It works by lowering the amount of HIV in the blood and will also help your immune system. This may help delay problems that are usually related to AIDS or HIV disease from occurring. This medicine will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have other problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet
-> Capsule

Check with your doctor if you or your child has muscle pain, tenderness, wasting, or unusual tiredness or weakness while you are using this medicine.

Zidovudine may cause blood and bone marrow problems. Symptoms of bone marrow problems include fever, chills, sore throat pale skin, or unusual tiredness or weakness.
