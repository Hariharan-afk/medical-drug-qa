Description:
Phenolsulfonphthalein is used as a test to help diagnose problems or disease of the kidneys. This test determines how well your kidneys are working.

Phenolsulfonphthalein passes out of the body almost entirely in the urine. Measuring the amount of phenolsulfonphthalein in the urine can help the doctor determine if the kidneys are working properly.

How test is done: After you have emptied your bladder, phenolsulfonphthalein will be given by injection. Then you will be asked to empty your bladder into a container one or more times after the medicine is given. The amount of this medicine in your urine will be measured. Then the results of the test will be studied. The way the phenolsulfonphthalein test is done may be different for different patients. Some patients may have the phenolsulfonphthalein injected into a vein, others, into a muscle.

It is very important that you empty the bladder completely and collect all the urine when you are asked to do so. If any urine is left behind or lost, it will change the results of the test.

Phenolsulfonphthalein is to be used only under the supervision of a doctor.


Before Using:
In deciding to use a diagnostic test, any risks of the test must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. Also, other things may affect test results. For this test, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Although there is no specific information comparing use of phenolsulfonphthalein in children with use in other age groups, phenolsulfonphthalein is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in children than it does in adults.


Geriatric:
Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. Although there is no specific information comparing use of phenolsulfonphthalein in the elderly with use in other age groups, this medicine is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults.


Drug Interactions:
Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.


Other Interactions:
Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.  Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.  Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.


Other Medical Problems:
The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this diagnostic test. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

-> Gout or
-> Liver disease or
-> Multiple myeloma (a kind of cancer)—These conditions may affect how fast the body gets rid of the phenolsulfonphthalein
-> Heart or blood vessel disease or
-> Kidney disease (severe)—Patients with these conditions are at greater risk of becoming ill because of the large amount of liquids that must be taken for this test
