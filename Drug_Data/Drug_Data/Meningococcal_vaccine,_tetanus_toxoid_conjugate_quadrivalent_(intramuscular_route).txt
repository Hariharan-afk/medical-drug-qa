Description:
Meningococcal, tetanus toxoid conjugate quadrivalent vaccine is an active immunizing agent used to prevent infection caused by certain groups of meningococcal bacteria ( Neisseria meningitides ). The vaccine works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.

This vaccine is active against Groups A, C, W, and Y meningococcal bacteria only. The vaccine will not protect against infection caused by other meningococcal bacteria groups, such as Group B.

Meningococcal infection can cause life-threatening illnesses, such as meningococcal meningitis, which affects the brain, and meningococcemia, which affects the blood. Some persons with meningococcal meningitis and/or meningococcemia also may die. These diseases are more likely to occur in young children and in persons with certain diseases or conditions that make them more susceptible to a meningococcal infection or more likely to develop serious problems from a meningococcal infection.

This vaccine is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Solution
-> Powder for Suspension

Precautions:
