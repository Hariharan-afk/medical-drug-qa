Description:
Isosorbide mononitrate is used to prevent angina (chest pain) caused by coronary artery disease (heart disease). It does not work fast enough to relieve the pain of an angina attack that has already started.

Isosorbide mononitrate belongs to the group of medicines called nitrates. It works by relaxing the blood vessels and increasing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its workload. When used regularly on a long-term basis, this helps prevent angina attacks from occurring.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet, Extended Release
-> Tablet

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of isosorbide mononitrate in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of isosorbide mononitrate in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have severe low blood pressure and age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving isosorbide mononitrate.


Breastfeeding:
There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.

In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

Your doctor will schedule your doses during the day to allow for a drug-free time. Follow the schedule of dosing carefully so the medicine will work properly.

Swallow the  extended-release tablet  whole with a half glass of water. Do not split, crush, or chew it.
