Description:
Morphine injection is used to treat pain severe enough to require opioid treatment and when other pain medicines did not work well enough or cannot be tolerated. It may also be used before or during surgery with an anesthetic (medicine that puts you to sleep). Morphine belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines). It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain.

When a narcotic medicine is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Solution

Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of morphine injection in children 1 month of age and older. Safety and efficacy in infants younger than 1 month of age have not been established.
