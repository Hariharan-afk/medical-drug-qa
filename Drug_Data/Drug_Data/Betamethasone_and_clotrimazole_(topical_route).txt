To help clear up your skin infection completely and to help make sure it does not return, the following good health habits are important:

-> For patients using this medicine for athlete's foot: Carefully dry the feet, especially between the toes, after bathing. Avoid wearing socks made from wool or synthetic materials (eg, rayon or nylon). Instead, wear clean, cotton socks and change them daily or more often if your feet sweat freely. Wear well-ventilated shoes (eg, shoes with holes) or sandals. Use a bland, absorbent powder (eg, talcum powder) or an antifungal powder freely between the toes, on the feet, and in socks and shoes once or twice a day. Be sure to use the powder after clotrimazole and betamethasone combination cream has been applied and has disappeared into the skin. Do not use the powder as the only treatment for your fungus infection. These measures will help keep the feet cool and dry.

Be sure to use the powder after clotrimazole and betamethasone combination cream has been applied and has disappeared into the skin. Do not use the powder as the only treatment for your fungus infection. These measures will help reduce chafing and irritation and will also help keep the groin area cool and dry.
