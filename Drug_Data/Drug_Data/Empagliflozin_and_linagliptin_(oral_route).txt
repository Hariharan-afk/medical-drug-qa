Description:
Empagliflozin and linagliptin combination is used together with proper diet and exercise to treat high blood sugar levels caused by type 2 diabetes. It is also used to lower the risk of death in patients with type 2 diabetes and heart or blood vessel disease. Empagliflozin works in the kidneys to prevent the absorption of glucose (blood sugar). Linagliptin helps to control blood sugar levels by increasing substances in the body that make the pancreas release more insulin. It also signals the liver to stop producing sugar (glucose) when there is too much sugar in the blood. This medicine does not help patients who have insulin-dependent or type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetic patients must use insulin injections.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
