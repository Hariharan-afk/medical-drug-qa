Spiriva Respimat


Description:
Tiotropium is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a lung disease that also includes chronic bronchitis (swelling of the tubes leading to the lungs) and emphysema (damage to the air sacs in the lungs). It is also used as maintenance treatment for asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older.

Tiotropium belongs to the family of medicines known as bronchodilators. Bronchodilators are breathed in through the mouth to help open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. It is taken by inhalation (an inhaler) and will increase the flow of air to the lungs.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Spray
-> Capsule

Pediatric:
