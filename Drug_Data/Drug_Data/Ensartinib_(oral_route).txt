Description:
Ensartinib is used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread in patients who have not received other medicines (eg, ALK-inhibitors) and whose tumors have an abnormal anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. Your doctor will perform a test to check for the ALK gene before you use this medicine.

Ensartinib belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics (cancer medicines). It works by interfering with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
