Description:
Butalbital and acetaminophen combination is used to relieve symptoms of tension (or muscle contraction) headaches.

Butalbital belongs to the group of medicines called barbiturates. They act in the central nervous system (CNS) to produce their effects.

Acetaminophen is used to relieve pain and reduce fever in patients. It does not become habit-forming when taken for a long time. But acetaminophen may cause other unwanted effects when taken in large doses, including serious liver damage. Although rare, use of acetaminophen has been reported to lead to liver transplantation and death, usually at high doses and when multiple acetaminophen-containing products have been used.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
