To help clear up your infection completely, it is very important that  you keep using this medicine for the full time of treatment , even if your symptoms begin to clear up or you begin to feel better after a few days. Since fungal infections may be very slow to clear up, you may need to take this medicine for several weeks or months. If you stop taking this medicine too soon, your symptoms may return.

This medicine works best when there is a constant amount in the blood. To help keep the amount constant, do not miss any doses. Also, it is best to take the doses at the same times every day. If you need help in planning the best time to take your medicine, check with your doctor.

If you are using the  oral granules , you may sprinkle the contents on a spoonful of pudding or other soft, non-acidic food such as mashed potatoes. This mixture must be swallowed immediately without chewing. Do not use applesauce or fruit-based foods. If you will need two packets of oral granules with each dose, you may sprinkle the content of both packets on one spoonful or two spoonfuls of non-acidic food.

Avoid caffeine (coffee, soda, chocolate) while you are using this medicine. Terbinafine may cause caffeine to stay in your body longer than usual.
