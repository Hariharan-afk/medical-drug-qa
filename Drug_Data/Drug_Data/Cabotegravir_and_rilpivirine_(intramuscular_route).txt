USBrand Name:
Cabenuva


Description:
Cabotegravir and rilpivirine combination injection are used together for the treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This medicine is usually given to patients to replace their current anti-HIV medicines when their healthcare provider determines that they meet certain requirements.

Cabotegravir and rilpivirine combination injection will not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS. It helps keep HIV from reproducing and appears to slow down the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay problems that are usually related to AIDS or HIV disease from occurring. This medicine will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have other problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Suspension, Extended Release

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of cabotegravir and rilpivirine combination injection in the elderly.
