Before Using:

Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines.

Pediatric:

Geriatric:

Precautions:
It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits  to make sure this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Inotersen injection will lower the number of some types of blood cells in your body. Because of this, you may bleed or get infections more easily. To help with these problems, avoid being near people who are sick or have infections. Wash your hands often. Stay away from rough sports or other situations where you could be bruised, cut, or injured. Brush and floss your teeth gently. Be careful when using sharp objects, including razors and fingernail clippers.

Check with your doctor right away if you have bloody urine, a decrease in frequency or amount of urine, an increase in blood pressure, increased thirst, loss of appetite, lower back or side pain, nausea, swelling of the face, fingers, or lower legs, troubled breathing, unusual tiredness or weakness, vomiting, or weight gain. These could be symptoms of a serious kidney problem.

This medicine may increase your risk for inflammatory or immune system problems, stroke, or arterial dissection (tear in the lining of a brain artery). Check with your doctor if you have confusion, difficulty in speaking, slow speech, inability to speak, inability to move the arms, legs, or facial muscles, double vision, headache, spasms in the legs, back pain, or weight loss.

Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.

This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after using this medicine.

This medicine may lower the vitamin A levels in your body, which may cause eye or vision problems (eg, night blindness, blurred vision, difficulty with reading, or any other change in vision). Your doctor may want your eyes to be checked by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor).

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
