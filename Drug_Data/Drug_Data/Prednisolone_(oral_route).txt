Description:
Prednisolone provides relief for inflamed areas of the body. It is used to treat a number of different conditions, such as inflammation (swelling), severe allergies, adrenal problems, arthritis, asthma, blood or bone marrow problems, eye or vision problems, lupus, skin conditions, kidney problems, ulcerative colitis, and flare-ups of multiple sclerosis. Prednisolone is a corticosteroid (cortisone-like medicine or steroid). It works on the immune system to help relieve swelling, redness, itching, and allergic reactions.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet
-> Syrup

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of prednisolone  disintegrating tablets  and  oral liquid  in children younger than 2 years of age  to treat nephrotic syndrome  and in children younger than 1 month of age  to treat cancer (eg, aggressive lymphoma and leukemia) . Safety and efficacy have not been established. Because prednisolone may cause slowed growth in children, those who will be using it for a long time should have their weight and growth measured by a doctor regularly.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of prednisolone in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney and bone problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for elderly patients receiving prednisolone.
