Description:
Desirudin is used to prevent deep venous thrombosis, a condition in which harmful blood clots form in the blood vessels of the legs. These blood clots can travel to the lungs and can become lodged in the blood vessels of the lungs, causing a condition called pulmonary embolism. This medicine is used for several days after hip replacement surgery, while you are unable to walk. It is during this time that blood clots are most likely to form.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.


Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of desirudin in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

This medicine may cause a serious type of allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash; itching; swelling of the face, tongue, and throat; trouble breathing; or chest pain after you receive this medicine.

Make sure your doctor knows if you have had an allergic reaction to similar medicines such as bivalirudin, lepirudin, Angiomax®, Angiox®, or Refludan®.

Desirudin may increase your chance of bleeding or bruising. This risk is higher if you have a catheter in your back for pain medicine or anesthesia (sometimes called an "epidural"), or if you have kidney problems. The risk of bleeding increases as the severity of your kidney problems increases. Check with your doctor right away if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising; black, tarry stools; bleeding gums; blood in the urine or stools; or pinpoint red spots on your skin.

You may bleed and bruise more easily while you are using this medicine. Stay away from rough sports or other situations where you could be bruised, cut, or injured. Be careful when using sharp objects, including razors and fingernail clippers. Avoid nose picking and forceful nose blowing.

Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.

Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using this medicine. You may need to stop using desirudin several days before having surgery or medical tests.

Do not take or discontinue other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines, and herbal or vitamin supplements.
