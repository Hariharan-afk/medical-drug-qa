Description:
Doravirine, lamivudine, and tenofovir combination is used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in patients who have not been treated with antiviral medicines before, or in patients to replace their current HIV-1 medicines who have met certain doctor's requirements. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Doravirine, lamivudine, and tenofovir combination will not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS. It works by lowering the amount of HIV in the blood and will also help your immune system. This may help delay problems that are usually related to AIDS or HIV disease from occurring. People who receive this medicine may continue to have other problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.
