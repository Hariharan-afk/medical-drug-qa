Description:
Oxymorphone injection is used to treat moderate to severe pain, including labor pain. It may also be given before surgery or with a general anesthetic (medicine that puts you to sleep), and may be used to relieve anxiety for patients with breathing problems from pulmonary edema caused by heart disease.

Oxymorphone belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines). It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain.

When oxymorphone is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.


Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of oxymorphone injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of oxymorphone injection in the elderly.
