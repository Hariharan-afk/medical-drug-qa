Description:
Triamcinolone injection provides relief for inflamed areas of the body. It is used to treat a number of different conditions, such as inflammation (swelling), severe allergies, adrenal problems, arthritis, blood or bone marrow problems, eye or vision problems, lung or breathing problems (eg, asthma), lupus, skin conditions, kidney problems, ulcerative colitis, and flare-ups of multiple sclerosis. Triamcinolone is a corticosteroid (cortisone-like medicine or steroid). It works on the immune system to help relieve swelling, redness, itching, and allergic reactions.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Suspension
-> Powder for Suspension, Extended Release

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of triamcinolone injection in the pediatric population. However, pediatric patients are more likely to have slower growth and bone problems if triamcinolone injection is used for a long time. Recommended doses should not be exceeded, and the patient should be carefully monitored during treatment.

Triamcinolone injection contains benzyl alcohol, which may cause serious unwanted effects in premature infants.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of triamcinolone injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of this medicine than younger adults and are more likely to have liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for elderly patients receiving triamcinolone injection.

Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.
