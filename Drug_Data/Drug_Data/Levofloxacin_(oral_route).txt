Levofloxacin belongs to the class of medicines known as quinolone antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria or preventing their growth. However, this medicine will not work for colds, flu, or other virus infections.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of levofloxacin in children. However, because of this medicine's toxicity, it should be used with caution, after other alternatives have been considered or found ineffective. Levofloxacin may be used in children 6 months of age and older to prevent anthrax infection after possible exposure, and to treat plague infection.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of levofloxacin in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related tendon disorders (including tendon rupture) and kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving levofloxacin.
