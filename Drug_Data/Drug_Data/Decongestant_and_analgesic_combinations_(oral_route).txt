Novahistex Sinus


Description:
Decongestant and analgesic combinations are taken by mouth to relieve sinus and nasal congestion (stuffy nose) and headache of colds, allergy, and hay fever.

Decongestants, such as phenylephrine, and pseudoephedrine produce a narrowing of blood vessels. This leads to clearing of nasal congestion, but it may also cause an increase in blood pressure in patients who have high blood pressure.

Analgesics, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and salicylates (e.g., aspirin, salicylamide), are used in these combination medicines to help relieve headache and sinus pain.

Acetaminophen and salicylates may cause kidney damage or cancer of the kidney or urinary bladder if large amounts of both medicines are taken together for a long time. However, taking the recommended amounts of combination medicines that contain both acetaminophen and a salicylate for short periods of time has not been shown to cause these unwanted effects.

These medicines are available without a prescription. However, your doctor may have special instructions on the proper dose of these medicines for your medical condition.

Do not give any over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medicine to a baby or child under 4 years of age.  Using these medicines in very young children might cause serious or possibly life-threatening side effects .

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Capsule
-> Tablet
-> Tablet, Extended Release
-> Capsule, Liquid Filled
-> Tablet, Extended Release, 12 HR
-> Tablet, Effervescent

Before Using:

Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Very young children are usually more sensitive to the effects of this medicine.  Before giving any of these combination medicines to a child, check the package label very carefully. Some of these medicines are too strong for use in children . If you are not certain whether a specific product can be given to a child, or if you have any questions about the amount to give, check with your health care professional, especially if it contains:

-> Decongestants (e.g., phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine)—Increases in blood pressure may be more likely to occur in children taking decongestants.
-> Salicylates (e.g., aspirin)—Do not give aspirin or other salicylates to a child or teenager with a fever or other symptoms of a virus infection, especially flu or chickenpox, without first discussing its use with your child's doctor. This is very important because salicylates may cause a serious illness called Reye's syndrome in these children. Also, children may be more sensitive to the aspirin or other salicylates contained in some of these medicines, especially if they have a fever or have lost large amounts of body fluid because of vomiting, diarrhea, or sweating.

Geriatric:
The elderly are usually more sensitive to the effects of this medicine.


Pregnancy:
The occasional use of decongestant and analgesic combinations at the doses recommended on the label is not likely to cause problems in the fetus or in the newborn baby. However, for the individual ingredients of these combinations, the following information applies:

-> Alcohol—Some of these combination medicines contain large amounts of alcohol. Too much use of alcohol during pregnancy may cause birth defects.
-> —Studies in humans have not shown that caffeine causes birth defects. However, studies in animals have shown that caffeine causes birth defects when given in very large doses (amounts equal to the amount of caffeine contained in 12 to 24 cups of coffee a day).
-> Ibuprofen—Studies on birth defects have not been done in humans. However, there is a chance that ibuprofen may cause unwanted effects on the heart or blood flow of the fetus or newborn baby if it is taken regularly during the last few months of pregnancy.
-> Phenylephrine—Studies on birth defects have not been done in either humans or animals with phenylephrine.
-> Pseudoephedrine—Studies on birth defects with pseudoephedrine have not been done in humans. In animal studies pseudoephedrine did not cause birth defects. However, when given to animals in high doses, pseudoephedrine did cause a decrease in average weight, length, and rate of bone formation in the animal fetus.
-> Salicylates (e.g., aspirin)—Studies on birth defects in humans have been done with aspirin, but not with salicylamide. Although salicylates have been shown to cause birth defects in animals, they have not been shown to cause birth defects in humans.
Regular use of salicylates late in pregnancy may cause unwanted effects on the heart or blood flow in the fetus or newborn baby. Use of salicylates during the last 2 weeks of pregnancy may cause bleeding problems in the fetus before or during delivery, or in the newborn baby. Also, too much use of salicylates during the last 3 months of pregnancy may increase the length of pregnancy, prolong labor and cause other problems during delivery, or cause severe bleeding in the mother before, during, or after delivery.   Do not take aspirin during the last 3 months of pregnancy unless it has been ordered by your doctor .


Breastfeeding:
If you are breast-feeding the chance that problems might occur depends on the ingredients of the combination. For the individual ingredients of these combinations, the following apply:

-> Acetaminophen—Acetaminophen passes into the breast milk. However, it has not been reported to cause problems in nursing babies.
-> Alcohol—Alcohol passes into the breast milk. However, the amount of alcohol in recommended doses of this medicine does not usually cause problems in nursing babies.
-> Caffeine—Small amounts of caffeine pass into the breast milk and may build up in the nursing baby. However, the amount of caffeine in recommended doses of this medicine does not usually cause problems in nursing babies.
-> Decongestants (e.g., phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine)—Decongestants may pass into the breast milk and may cause unwanted effects in nursing babies of mothers taking this medicine.
-> Salicylates (e.g., aspirin)—Salicylates pass into the breast milk. Although salicylates have not been reported to cause problems in nursing babies, it is possible that problems may occur if large amounts are taken regularly.
