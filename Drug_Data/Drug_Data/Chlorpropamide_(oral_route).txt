Description:
Chlorpropamide is used to treat high blood sugar levels caused by a type of diabetes mellitus called type 2 diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, your body does not work properly to store excess sugar and the sugar remains in your blood. High blood sugar over a long time can lead to serious health problems.

Proper diet is the first step in managing type 2 diabetes, but often medicines are needed. Chlorpropamide belongs to a class of drugs called sulfonylureas. It increases the release of insulin from the pancreas, which helps your body store sugar. This also lowers the level of sugar in the blood and restores the way you use food to make energy.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet

Before Using:

Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of chlorpropamide in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

Symptoms of low blood sugar include anxiety; behavior change similar to being drunk; blurred vision; cold sweats; confusion; cool, pale skin; difficulty with thinking; drowsiness; excessive hunger; fast heartbeat; headache (continuing); nausea; nervousness; nightmares; restless sleep; shakiness; slurred speech; or unusual tiredness or weakness.

If symptoms of low blood sugar occur, eat glucose tablets or gel, corn syrup, honey, or sugar cubes; or drink fruit juice, non-diet soft drink, or sugar dissolved in water. Also, check your blood for low blood sugar. Glucagon is used in emergency situations when severe symptoms such as seizures (convulsions) or unconsciousness occur.
