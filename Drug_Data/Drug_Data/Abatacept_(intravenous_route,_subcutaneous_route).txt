Abatacept injection is used alone or together with other medicines to treat moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis. Abatacept helps keep joint damage from getting worse after other medicines have been used and did not work well.

Abatacept injection is also used alone or together with other medicines to treat active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), which is a type of arthritis that causes pain and swelling in the joints along with patches of scaly skin on some areas of the body.

Abatacept injection is also used together with other medicines (eg, calcineurin inhibitor, methotrexate) to prevent acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) in patients who will undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a matched or 1 allele-mismatched unrelated donor.
