Description:
Fluticasone and vilanterol combination is used to help control the symptoms of asthma and improve lung function. It is used when a patient's asthma has not been controlled sufficiently on other asthma medicines, or when a patient's condition is so severe that more than one medicine is needed every day. This medicine will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.

Fluticasone and vilanterol combination used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It is used long term to improve breathing problems and to reduce the number of COPD flare-ups (worsening of your COPD symptoms for several days). This medicine will not relieve a COPD attack that has already started.

Inhaled fluticasone belongs to the family of medicines known as corticosteroids or steroids (cortisone-like medicines). It works by preventing certain cells in the lungs and breathing passages from releasing substances that cause COPD and asthma symptoms.

Inhaled vilanterol is a long-acting bronchodilator. Bronchodilators are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
