Description:
Estrogens are hormones produced by the body. Among other things, estrogens help develop and maintain female organs.

When your body is in short supply of this hormone, replacing it can ease the uncomfortable changes that occur in the vagina, vulva (female genitals), and urethra (part of the urinary system). Conditions that are treated with vaginal estrogens include a genital skin condition (vulvar atrophy), inflammation of the vagina (atrophic vaginitis), and inflammation of the urethra (atrophic urethritis).

Estrogens work partly by increasing a normal clear discharge from the vagina and making the vulva and urethra healthy. Using or applying an estrogen relieves or lessens:

-> Dryness and soreness in the vagina
-> Itching, redness, or soreness of the vulva
-> Feeling an urge to urinate more often then is needed or experiencing pain while urinating
-> Pain during sexual intercourse
When used vaginally or on the skin, most estrogens are absorbed into the bloodstream and cause some, but not all, of the same effects as when they are taken by mouth. Estrogens used vaginally at very low doses for treating local problems of the genitals and urinary system will not protect against osteoporosis or stop the hot flushes caused by menopause.

Estrogens for vaginal use are available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Insert, Extended Release
-> Capsule, Liquid Filled
-> Cream
-> Tablet

Before Using:

Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Estrogen vaginal cream is not indicated in children. Studies have not been conducted.


Geriatric:
Elderly women greater than 65 years of age may have an increased risk of certain side effects during treatment, especially stroke, invasive breast cancer, and memory problems.


Pregnancy:
Estrogens should not be used during pregnancy, since an estrogen called diethylstilbestrol (DES) that is no longer taken for hormone replacement has caused serious birth defects in humans and animals.

Use of this medicine is not recommended in nursing mothers. Estrogens pass into the breast milk and may decrease the amount and quality of breast milk. Caution should be exercised in mothers who are using estrogen and breast-feeding.

Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.


Precautions:
It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine does not cause unwanted effects . Plan on going to see your doctor every year, but some doctors require visits more often.

It is not yet known whether the use of vaginal estrogens increases the risk of breast cancer in women. It is very important that you check your breasts on a regular basis for any unusual lumps or discharge. Report any problems to your doctor. You should also have a mammogram (x-ray picture of the breasts) done if your doctor recommends it.

It is important that you have a regular pelvic exam (pap smear). Your doctor will tell you how often this exam should be done.

Talk to your doctor if you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol (fats in the blood), or diabetes, use tobacco, or are overweight. You may have a higher risk for getting heart disease.

Although the chance is low, use of estrogen may increase your chance of getting cancer of the ovary or uterus (womb). Regular visits to your health professional can help identify these serious side effects early.

If you think that you may be pregnant, stop using the medicine immediately and check with your doctor .

Tell the doctor in charge that you are using this medicine before having any laboratory test, because some test results may be affected.

For vaginal creams or suppositories:

-> Avoid using latex condoms, diaphragms, or cervical caps for up to 72 hours after using estrogen vaginal creams. Certain estrogen products may contain oils in the creams that can weaken latex (rubber) products and cause condoms to break or leak, or cervical caps or diaphragms to wear out sooner. Check with your health care professional to make sure the vaginal estrogen product you are using can be used with latex devices.
-> This medicine is often used at bedtime to increase effectiveness through better absorption.
-> Vaginal creams or suppositories will melt and leak out of the vagina. A minipad or sanitary napkin will protect your clothing. Do not use tampons (like those used for menstrual periods) since they may soak up the medicine and make the medicine less effective.
-> Avoid exposing your male sexual partner to your vaginal estrogen cream or suppository by not having sexual intercourse right after using these medicines. Your male partner might absorb the medicine through his penis if it comes in contact with the medicine.
For estradiol vaginal inserts or rings:

-> Contact your doctor if you have problems removing your vaginal insert.
-> It is not necessary to remove the vaginal insert for sexual intercourse unless you prefer to remove it.
-> If you do take it out, or if it accidentally slips or comes out of the vagina, you can replace the vaginal insert in the vagina after washing it with lukewarm water. Never use hot or boiling water.
-> If it slips down, gently push it upwards and back into place.
-> Replace the vaginal insert every 3 months.
-> Talk to your doctor on a regular basis about how long to use the vaginal insert.

Side Effects:
The risk of any serious adverse effect is unlikely for most women using low doses of estrogens vaginally. Even women with special risks have used vaginal estrogens without problems.

Check with your doctor immediately  if any of the following side effects occur:


Less common:
-> Breast pain
-> enlarged breasts
-> itching of the vagina or genitals
-> headache
-> nausea
-> stinging or redness of the genital area
-> thick, white vaginal discharge without odor or with a mild odor

Rare:
-> Feeling of vaginal pressure (with estradiol vaginal insert or ring)
-> unusual or unexpected uterine bleeding or spotting
-> vaginal burning or pain (with estradiol vaginal insert or ring)

Incidence not known:
-> Diarrhea
-> dizziness
-> fast heartbeat
-> feeling faint
-> fever
-> hives
-> hoarseness
-> itching
-> joint pain, stiffness, or swelling
-> muscle pain
-> rash
-> shortness of breath
-> skin redness
-> swelling of eyelids, face, lips, hands, or feet
-> tightness in the chest
-> trouble with breathing or swallowing
-> vomiting
-> wheezing
Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:

-> Abdominal or back pain
-> clear vaginal discharge (usually means the medicine is working)
-> Acne
-> enlargement of penis or testes
-> growth of pubic hair
-> rapid increase in height
-> swelling of the breasts or breast soreness in males
Also, many women who are using estrogens with a progestin (another female hormone) will start having monthly vaginal bleeding that is similar to menstrual periods. This effect will continue for as long as the medicine is taken. However, monthly bleeding will not occur in women who have had the uterus removed by surgery (hysterectomy).

Other side effects not listed may also occur in some patients. If you notice any other effects, check with your healthcare professional.

Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.
