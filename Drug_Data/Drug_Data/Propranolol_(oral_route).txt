Propranolol HCl Intensol


Description:
Propranolol is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure may reduce the risk of stroke and heart attacks.

Propranolol is also used to treat severe chest pain (angina), migraine headaches, or hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (thickened heart muscle).

This medicine may also be used to treat irregular heartbeats, tremors, or pheochromocytoma (adrenal gland tumor). It may also be used to reduce the risk of death in patients who have heart attacks.

Propranolol  oral solution  is used to treat proliferating infantile hemangioma.

This medicine is a beta-blocker. It works by affecting the response to nerve impulses in certain parts of the body, like the heart. As a result, the heart beats slower and decreases the blood pressure. When the blood pressure is lowered, the amount of blood and oxygen is increased to the heart.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Capsule, Extended Release
-> Solution
-> Tablet

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Pediatric:

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of propranolol  oral solution  in children.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of propranolol  oral solution  to treat proliferating infantile hemangioma in children 5 weeks to 5 months of age. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children older than 1 year of age.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of propranolol in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving propranolol.
