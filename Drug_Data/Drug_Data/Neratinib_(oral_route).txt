Description:
Neratinib is used to treat patients with HER2-overexpressed or amplified breast cancer that has been previously treated with trastuzumab. Neratinib is also used in combination with capecitabine to treat advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer (breast cancer that has already spread) in patients who have received two or more anti-HER2 based regimens. It belongs to the group of medicines, called antineoplastics.

Neratinib interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by the medicine, other unwanted effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
