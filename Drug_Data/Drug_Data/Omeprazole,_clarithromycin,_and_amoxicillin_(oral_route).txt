Description:
Omeclamox®-Pak is a product containing three components: omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin. This medicine is used to treat patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcers caused by H. pylori bacteria (germ).

Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It works by decreasing the amount of acid produced by the stomach. Clarithromycin and amoxicillin both belong to the class of medicines known as antibiotics. They work by killing bacteria or preventing their growth. However, this medicine will not work for colds, flu, or other virus infections.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
