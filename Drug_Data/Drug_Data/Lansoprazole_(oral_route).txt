Prevacid SoluTab


Description:
Lansoprazole is used to treat certain conditions where there is too much acid in the stomach. It is used to treat duodenal and gastric ulcers, gastric ulcers caused by NSAID use, erosive esophagitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is a condition wherein the acid in the stomach washes back up into the esophagus. Sometimes lansoprazole is used in combination with antibiotics (eg, amoxicillin, clarithromycin) to treat ulcers associated with an infection caused by H. pylori bacteria.

Lansoprazole is also used to treat Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES), which is a condition where the stomach produces too much acid.

Lansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It works by decreasing the amount of acid produced by the stomach.

This medicine is available both over-the-counter (OTC) and with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Capsule, Delayed Release
-> Tablet Disintegrating, Delayed Release
-> Powder for Suspension

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of lansoprazole to treat GERD and erosive esophagitis in children 1 to 17 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 1 year of age. This medicine may increase the risk for heart problems (eg, heart valve thickening) in children younger than 1 year of age.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of lansoprazole in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of this medicine than younger adults.
