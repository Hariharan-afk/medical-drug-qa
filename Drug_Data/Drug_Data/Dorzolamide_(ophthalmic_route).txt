If you normally wear soft contact lenses, remove them before you use dorzolamide eye drops. Wait at least for 15 minutes before putting the contact lenses back in.

To use the eye drops:

-> Wash your hands with soap and water.
-> Before using this medicine for the first time, make sure that the safety strip on the bottle is unbroken.
-> Tear off the safety strip to break the seal and open the bottle by unscrewing the cap by turning as indicated by the arrows on the top of the cap. Do not pull the cap directly up and away from the bottle.
-> Tilt your head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Drop the medicine into this space.
-> Invert the bottle, and press lightly the "finger push area" using your thumb or index finger.
-> Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eye. Do not blink. Keep the eye closed for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to cover the eye.
-> If you think you did not get the drop of medicine into your eye properly, replace the cap on the bottle and tighten. Then, remove by turning the cap in the opposite direction as indicated by the arrows on the top of the cap and repeat the process with another drop.
-> Replace the cap by turning until it is firmly touching the bottle. Do not overtighten or you may damage the bottle and cap.
-> Wash your hands after using the eye drops to remove any medicine.
-> Never touch the applicator tip to any surface, including the eye, and keep the container tightly closed. This will keep the medicine as germ-free as possible.
If your doctor ordered two different eye drops to be used together, wait at least 5 minutes between the times you apply the medicines. This will help to keep the second medicine from “washing out” the first one.
