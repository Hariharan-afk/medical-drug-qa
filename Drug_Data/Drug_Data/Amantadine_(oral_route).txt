Description:
Amantadine is an antidyskinetic medicine. It is used to treat Parkinson's disease (sometimes called "paralysis agitans" or "shaking palsy") and its symptoms, including dyskinesia (sudden uncontrolled movements). It may be given alone or in combination with other medicines (eg, levodopa) for Parkinson's disease. By improving muscle control and reducing stiffness, this medicine allows more normal movements of the body as the disease symptoms are reduced. Amantadine is also used to treat stiffness and shakiness caused by certain medicines that are used to treat nervous, mental, and emotional conditions.

Amantadine is also an antiviral medicine. It is used to prevent or treat certain influenza (flu) infections (type A). It may be given alone or together with flu shots. Amantadine will not work for colds, other types of flu, or other virus infections.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet, Extended Release

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines.

For patients taking amantadine to prevent or treat flu infections :

-> Talk to your doctor about the possibility of getting a flu shot if you have not had one yet.

Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.


Precautions:
It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits  to see if the medicine is working properly and to allow changes in your dose. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for any unwanted effects.

Amantadine may cause some people to be agitated, irritable, or display other abnormal behaviors. It may also cause some people to have suicidal thoughts and tendencies or to become more depressed. Also tell your doctor if you have sudden or strong feelings, such as feeling nervous, angry, restless, violent, or scared. If you, your child, or your caregiver notice any of these adverse effects, tell your doctor or your child's doctor right away.

Some people who have used this medicine had unusual changes in their behavior. Talk with your doctor right away if you start having unusual urges, such as gambling urges, binge or compulsive eating, compulsive shopping, or sexual urges while using this medicine.

Drinking alcoholic beverages while taking this medicine may cause increased side effects, such as circulation problems, dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, or confusion. Do not drink alcoholic beverages while you are taking this medicine.

This medicine may cause some people to become dizzy, drowsy, or lightheaded, or to have blurred vision or trouble concentrating. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you .

Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur with this medicine, especially when you suddenly get up from a lying or sitting position. These symptoms are more likely to occur when you begin taking this medicine or when the dose is increased. Getting up slowly may help. If this problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.

Patients with Parkinson's disease must be careful not to overdo physical activities when their condition improves and body movements become easier, since injuries resulting from falls may occur. Such activities must be gradually increased to give your body time to adjust to a change in balance, circulation, and coordination.

Amantadine may cause dryness of the mouth, nose, and throat. For temporary relief of mouth dryness, use sugarless candy or gum, melted bits of ice in your mouth, or use a saliva substitute. If your mouth continues to feel dry for more than 2 weeks, check with your doctor or dentist. Continuing dryness of the mouth may increase the chance of dental disease, including tooth decay, gum disease, and fungus infections.

This medicine may cause purplish red, net-like, blotchy spots on the skin. This problem occurs more often in females and usually occurs on the legs or feet after this medicine has been taken regularly for a month or more. Although the blotchy spots may remain as long as you are taking this medicine, they will usually go away gradually within 2 to 12 weeks after you stop taking the medicine. If you have any questions about this, talk with your doctor.

Check with your doctor right away if you are having convulsions (seizures), difficulty with breathing, a fast heartbeat, a high fever, high or low blood pressure, increased sweating, loss of bladder control, severe muscle stiffness, unusually pale skin, or tiredness. These could be symptoms of a serious condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).

If you are using this medicine for Parkinson's disease, do not stop taking this medicine suddenly without first checking with your doctor . Your doctor may want you to slowly reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely.

If you are using this medicine for Parkinson's disease, it is important that your doctor check your skin regularly for signs of melanoma (skin cancer). If you notice any unusual red, brown, or black spots on your skin, check with your doctor right away.

If your Parkinson's symptoms do not improve within a few days, if they become worse, or if this medicine appears less effective after a few weeks, check with your doctor.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
