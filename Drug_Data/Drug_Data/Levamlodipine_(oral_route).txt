Description:
Levamlodipine is used alone or together with other medicines to lower hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults and children. High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.

Levamlodipine is a calcium channel blocker. It affects the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. This relaxes the blood vessels and lowers blood pressure. A lower blood pressure will increase the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
