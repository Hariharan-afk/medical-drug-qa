Description:
Nicotine nasal spray is used to help you stop smoking. Nicotine is absorbed in the nose and enters the blood stream. This replaces the nicotine you would get from smoking and makes the withdrawal effects from not smoking less severe. The amount of nicotine is decreased over time until use is stopped.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
