Description:
Moclobemide is a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor used to treat certain types of mental depression. It works by blocking the action of a chemical substance known as monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the nervous system.

Although this medicine is very effective for certain patients, it may also cause some unwanted reactions if taken the wrong way. It is very important to avoid certain beverages and medicines while you are using moclobemide. Your doctor may provide a list as a reminder of which products you should avoid.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.


Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.

Pediatric:
Studies on moclobemide have been done only in adult patients, and there is no specific information comparing use of moclobemide in children with use in other age groups.

Precautions:
When taken with certain drinks or other medicines, moclobemide and other monoamine oxidase inhibitors can cause very dangerous reactions, such as sudden high blood pressure (also called hypertensive crisis). To avoid such reactions, follow these rules of caution:

-> Do not drink excessive amounts of alcohol.
-> Do not take any other medicine unless approved or prescribed by your doctor. This especially includes nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine, such as medicine for colds (including nose drops or sprays), cough, hay fever, and appetite control; "stay awake" products; or products that make you sleepy.
Check with your doctor immediately if you experience any combination of the following symptoms: severe, throbbing headache that starts at the back of the head and radiates forward; stiff neck; fast or racing heartbeat; pounding, irregular, or slow heartbeat. These may be symptoms of a serious side effect that should have a doctor's attention.

Do not stop taking this medicine without first checking with your doctor. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely.

Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position suddenly. Getting up slowly may help. When you get up from lying down, sit on the edge of the bed with your feet dangling for 1 or 2 minutes, then stand up slowly. If the problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.

This medicine may cause blurred vision or make some people drowsy or less alert than they are normally. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are unable to see well or are not alert.

Before having any kind of surgery, dental treatment, or emergency treatment, tell the medical doctor or dentist in charge that you are using this medicine or have used it within the past 2 weeks. Taking moclobemide together with medicines that are used during surgery, dental, or emergency treatments may increase the risk of serious side effects.
