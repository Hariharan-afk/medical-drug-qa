Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of methylprednisolone injection in children. However, pediatric patients are more likely to have slower growth and bone problems if methylprednisolone injection is used for a long time. Recommended doses should not be exceeded, and the patient should be carefully monitored during treatment.

Depo-Medrol®  and some strengths of  Solu-Medrol®  injection should not be used in premature infants. Both brands of methylprednisolone injection contain benzyl alcohol, which may cause serious unwanted effects in premature infants.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of methylprednisolone injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for elderly patients receiving methylprednisolone injection.


Breastfeeding:
There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.

Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.
