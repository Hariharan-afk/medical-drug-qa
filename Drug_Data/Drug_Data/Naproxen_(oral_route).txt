Description:
Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve symptoms of arthritis (eg, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or juvenile arthritis) such as inflammation, swelling, stiffness, and joint pain. Naproxen also helps relieve symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis, which is a type of arthritis that affects the joints in the spine. However, this medicine does not cure arthritis and will help you only as long as you continue to take it.

This medicine may also be used to treat mild to moderate pain, including acute gout and other painful conditions such as bursitis, tendinitis, or menstrual cramps.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet, Enteric Coated
-> Tablet
-> Suspension
-> Tablet, Extended Release
-> Capsule, Liquid Filled

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of  naproxen controlled-release tablets  in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of  naproxen delayed release tablets, suspension, and tablets  in children younger than 2 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of naproxen in the elderly. However, elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of naproxen than younger adults, and are more likely to have age-related kidney or stomach problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving naproxen.
