Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of olanzapine in children. However, safety and efficacy of  olanzapine alone  in children younger than 13 years of age and  olanzapine and fluoxetine combination  in children younger than 10 years of age have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of olanzapine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have dementia or age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution or an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving olanzapine.
