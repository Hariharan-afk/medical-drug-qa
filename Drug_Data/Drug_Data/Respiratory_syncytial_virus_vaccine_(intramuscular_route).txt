Description:
Respiratory syncytial virus vaccine is an active immunizing agent used to prevent lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in adults 60 years of age and older. It is also given at 32 to 36 weeks of pregnancy to prevent LRTD and severe LRTD caused by RSV in infants from birth to 6 months of age. It works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.

Respiratory syncytial virus can cause serious breathing problems that may require hospitalization.

This vaccine is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Powder for Solution
