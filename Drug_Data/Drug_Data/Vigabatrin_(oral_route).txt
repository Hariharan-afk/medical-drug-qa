Description:
Vigabatrin is used alone or together with other medicines to treat refractory complex partial seizures in adults and children 2 years of age and older, and infantile spasms in children. It is used in patients who have already been treated with other medicines that did not work well.

Vigabatrin is an anticonvulsant. It increases the amount of the chemical called gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) in the brain. Some seizures are caused by low levels of GABA. When vigabatrin increases GABA, it reduces the likelihood of a seizure.

This medicine is available only under a restricted distribution program called Vigabatrin REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) Program.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Solution
-> Powder for Solution
-> Tablet
