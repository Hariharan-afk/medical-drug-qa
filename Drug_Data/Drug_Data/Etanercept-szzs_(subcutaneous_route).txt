Etanercept-szzs injection is used alone or with other medicines (eg, methotrexate) to reduce signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis, such as joint swelling, pain, tiredness, and duration of morning stiffness.

Etanercept-szzs injection is also used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. It is also used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in patients who may benefit from receiving phototherapy (ultraviolet light treatment) or other treatments.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.


Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of etanercept-szzs injection in children with  juvenile idiopathic arthritis  younger than 2 years of age and in children with  psoriasis  younger than 4 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of etanercept-szzs injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have infections, which may require caution in patients receiving etanercept-szzs.

Proper Use:
This medicine is given as a shot under the skin of your thigh, stomach, or upper arm. Etanercept-szzs may sometimes be given at home to patients who do not need to be in the hospital. If you or your child are using this medicine at home, your doctor or nurse will teach you how to prepare and inject the medicine. Be sure that you understand exactly how to use the medicine.

This medicine comes with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

If you use this medicine at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself or your child a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems.

This medicine is available in 3 forms. You may use a  prefilled syringe ,  prefilled Sensoready® pen , or a  vial .

The needle cap on the  prefilled syringe  and the internal needle cover within the cap of the  Sensoready® pen  contain dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to latex. Tell your doctor if you or your child have a latex allergy before you start using this medicine.

To use the  prefilled syringe or pen :

-> Wash your hands with soap and water before and after using this medicine.
-> Remove the carton with the syringe or pen from the refrigerator and place it on a clean cloth.
-> Allow 15 to 30 minutes for the syringe or autoinjector to warm up to room temperature.
-> Do not remove the needle cover on the prefilled syringe or pen while allowing the medicine to reach room temperature. Remove this just before use. Do not shake the medicine.
-> Check the liquid in the syringe or pen. It should be clear and colorless to slightly yellow, and may have small white particles. If it is cloudy, discolored, or has large particles in it, do not use it.
-> Choose an injection site on your body (eg, thigh, upper arms, or stomach area). Clean the injection site with a fresh alcohol wipe and let it dry.
-> Remove the cap or needle cover when you are ready to inject.
-> Do not inject into skin areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, hard, thick, scaly, has scars or stretch marks, or affected by psoriasis.
-> When using the Sensoready® Pen, the window in the pen turns green when the injection is complete. After removing the Sensoready® Pen, if the window has not turned green, or if it looks like the medicine is still injecting, it means you have not received a full dose. Call your doctor right away if this happens.
To use the  vial :

-> Use free-hand method for children who are using one vial for more than one dose.
-> Wash your hands with soap and water before and after using this medicine.

-> Attach the plunger into the gray rubber stopper in the syringe by turning it clockwise.
-> Turn the twist-off cap counter-clockwise. Do not touch the plunger and syringe tip.
-> Push the plunger down slowly until all the liquid from the syringe is in the vial. Do not add the liquid too fast as it will cause foaming.
-> Gently swirl the vial in a circular motion to dissolve the powder. Do not shake. Wait until all the powder is completely dissolved (usually less than 10 minutes).
-> Check the liquid in the vial. It should be clear and colorless. All powder must be fully dissolved. Do not use the medicine if the liquid is discolored, or has lumps, flakes, or particles in it.
-> Use a new needle and syringe each time you inject your medicine.
