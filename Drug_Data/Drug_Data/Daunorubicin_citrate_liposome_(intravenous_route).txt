Description:
Liposomal daunorubicin belongs to the general group of medicines known as antineoplastics. It is used to treat advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)–associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), a kind of skin cancer.

Liposomal daunorubicin seems to interfere with the growth of cancer cells, which eventually are destroyed. Since the growth of normal body cells also may be affected by liposomal daunorubicin, other effects will occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, like hair loss, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects may not occur until months or years after the medicine is used.

Precautions:
It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.

While you are being treated with liposomal daunorubicin, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. Liposomal daunorubicin may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent. In addition, other persons living in your household should not take oral poliovirus vaccine since there is a chance they could pass the poliovirus on to you. Also, avoid persons who have taken oral poliovirus vaccine. Do not get close to them, and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and the mouth.

Liposomal daunorubicin can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

-> If you can, avoid people with infection. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
-> Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising; black, tarry stools; blood in urine or stools; or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
-> Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
-> Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
-> Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
-> Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury can occur.
