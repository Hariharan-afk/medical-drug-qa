Description:
Triclabendazole is used to treat fascioliasis, an infection caused by the liver fluke parasite,  Fasciola hepatica .

Infections with a liver fluke usually occur after eating contaminated water plants, such as watercress or algae, or animals that eat these plants. They travel from your bowels to the bile ducts in the liver where they live and grow. Most patients infected with liver flukes do not show any symptoms, which may cause the infection to last a long time. To prevent getting infected with this parasite, cook your food properly before eating.
