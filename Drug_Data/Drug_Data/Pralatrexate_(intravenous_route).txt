Description:
Pralatrexate injection is used to treat peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) in patients who have already been treated with other medicines that did not work well. Peripheral T-cell lymphoma is a rare type of cancer that affects certain white blood cells and causes enlarged and swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, and groin.

Pralatrexate belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics (cancer medicines). It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by the medicine, other unwanted effects may also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.

This medicine is to be administered only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Solution

Before Using:

Pralatrexate can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting.

-> If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor right away if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
-> Check with your doctor right away if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising; black, tarry stools; blood in the urine or stools; or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
-> Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.

Check with your doctor right away if you have cracked lips, diarrhea, difficulty with swallowing, or sores, ulcers, or white spots on the lips, tongue, or inside of the mouth while you are receiving this medicine.
