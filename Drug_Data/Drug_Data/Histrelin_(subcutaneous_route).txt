Supprelin LA

Vantas


Description:
Histrelin is a synthetic (man-made) hormone that is similar to a natural hormone that is produced in the brain. This medicine works in the brain to reduce the blood levels of sex hormones, such as testosterone and estrogen. It is inserted just beneath the skin of the upper arm where it releases small amounts of histrelin in the body every day for 12 months.

Histrelin ( Vantas® ) is used to treat advanced prostate cancer in adults. It will reduce the level of testosterone, a male hormone, in the blood. Testosterone makes most prostate cancers grow. Histrelin is not a cure for prostate cancer, but it may help relieve the symptoms.

Histrelin ( Supprelin® LA ) is used to treat central precocious puberty (CPP) in children. CPP is a condition wherein puberty begins at an unusually early age. This usually means puberty occurs before 8 years of age in girls and before 9 years of age in boys.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a trained healthcare professional.

Do not remove the surgical strips. Allow them to fall off on their own after several days. If the incision has been stitched, your doctor will remove the stitches or they will dissolve after several days.

After the implant is inserted, you should keep the arm clean and dry. Do not swim or bathe for 24 hours. You should avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous exercise for the first 7 days after the implant is inserted.

The implant will be left in place for one year (12 months) and then removed. If needed, your doctor will insert a new implant to continue treatment for another year.
