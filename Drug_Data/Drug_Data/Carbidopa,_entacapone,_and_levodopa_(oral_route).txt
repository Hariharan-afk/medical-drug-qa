Description:
Carbidopa, entacapone, and levodopa combination is used to treat Parkinson's disease, sometimes called shaking palsy. Parkinson's disease is a disorder of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).

Dopamine is a naturally occurring substance in the brain that helps provide control of movement and activities such as walking and talking. In patients with Parkinson's disease, there is not enough dopamine in some parts of the brain. Levodopa (a component of this medicine) enters the brain and helps replace the missing dopamine, which allows people to function better. By increasing the amount of dopamine in the brain, levodopa helps control symptoms and helps you to perform daily activities such as dressing, walking, and handling utensils.

This medicine is a combination of three different medicines. This medicine is known as a levodopa therapy. The difference between this medicine and other levodopa treatments is that this medicine contains entacapone. Entacapone helps levodopa last longer by blocking a substance called COMT enzyme. This enzyme breaks down levodopa before it reaches the brain. When less levodopa is broken down, more is available to the brain. Increased availability of levodopa may lead to smoother and steadier levels of dopamine in the brain, which may provide better symptom control for longer periods each day. This may lead to improvement in daily activities.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of carbidopa, entacapone, and levodopa combination in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date in elderly patients up to age 75 years have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of carbidopa, entacapone, and levodopa combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, and cardiovascular insufficiency, which may require extra caution.
