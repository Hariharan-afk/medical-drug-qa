Description:
Emtricitabine, rilpivirine, and tenofovir alafenamide combination is used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This medicine is usually given to patients who have not received any HIV treatment in the past or to replace their current antiviral medicines provided that they meet certain requirements.

This medicine will not cure HIV infection or AIDS. It works by lowering the amount of HIV in the blood and it will also help your immune system. This may help delay some of the medical conditions that usually result from AIDS or HIV disease. It will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

If you are infected, it is best to avoid any sexual activity involving an exchange of body fluids with other people. If you do have sex, always wear (or have your partner wear) a condom (“rubber”).

Also, do not share needles or equipment with anyone or use dirty needles. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.
