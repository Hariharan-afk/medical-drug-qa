Description:
Buprenorphine and naloxone  sublingual tablet  is used to treat opioid (narcotic) dependence or addiction. Buprenorphine and naloxone  buccal film ,  sublingual film , or  sublingual tablet  is used for induction and maintenance treatment of opioid (narcotic) dependence. It should be used in patients who have already been treated with buprenorphine sublingual tablets.

When a narcotic medicine is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if the narcotic is stopped suddenly. Severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented when a person is switched to buprenorphine and naloxone combination. It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to help prevent the withdrawal side effects.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet
-> Film

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.

Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of buprenorphine and naloxone  buccal film ,  sublingual film , or  sublingual tablet  in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of buprenorphine and naloxone combination in the elderly.
