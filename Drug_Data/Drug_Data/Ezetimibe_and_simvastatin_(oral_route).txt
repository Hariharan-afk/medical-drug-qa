Description:
Ezetimibe and simvastatin combination is used together with a proper diet to treat high cholesterol and triglyceride (fat) levels in the blood in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). This medicine may help prevent certain types of heart problems in patients at high risk.

Ezetimibe is a cholesterol absorption inhibitor. This medicine will reduce the absorption of cholesterol from foods and the production of cholesterol in your body.

Simvastatin belongs to the group of medicines called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins. It works to reduce the amount of cholesterol in the blood by blocking an enzyme that is needed to make cholesterol.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of ezetimibe and simvastatin combination for the  treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and high cholesterol in the blood  in children younger than 10 years of age and for the  treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)  in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of ezetimibe and simvastatin combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, heart, or muscle problems (eg, myopathy), which may require caution in patients receiving ezetimibe and simvastatin combination.
