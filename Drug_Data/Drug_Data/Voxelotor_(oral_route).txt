Description:
Voxelotor is used to treat patients with sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder in which the red blood cells are abnormally shaped (crescent or sickle shape), that resulted from a mutation in the gene for hemoglobin. Voxelotor works by keeping the hemoglobin in an oxygenated state, thus helping the red blood cells maintain a normal shape and preventing them from binding together and blocking the flow in the blood vessels.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
