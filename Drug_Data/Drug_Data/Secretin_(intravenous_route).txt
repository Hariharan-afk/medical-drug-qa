Precautions:

Do not also use stomach medicines, such as a proton pump inhibitor and an H2 blocker together with secretin injection. This may cause an increase in the response to pancreas stimulation testing, which may lead to a false diagnosis of having gastrinoma (tumor in the bowel or pancreas).
