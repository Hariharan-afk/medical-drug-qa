Description:
Carbidopa and levodopa combination is used to treat Parkinson's disease, sometimes called shaking palsy or paralysis agitans. Parkinson's disease is a disorder of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).

Carbidopa and levodopa combination is also used to treat parkinsonism caused by encephalitis, or parkinsonism caused by carbon monoxide or manganese poisoning.

Dopamine is a naturally occurring substance in the brain that helps provide control of movement and activities such as walking and talking. In patients with Parkinson's disease, there is not enough dopamine in some parts of the brain. Levodopa enters the brain and helps replace the missing dopamine, which allows people to function better. By increasing the amount of dopamine in the brain, levodopa helps control symptoms and helps you to perform daily activities such as dressing, walking, and handling utensils.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
