Description:
Etravirine is used together with other medicines to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This medicine is usually given to patients who have received HIV treatment in the past.

Etravirine will not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS. It helps keep HIV from reproducing and appears to slow the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay problems that are usually related to AIDS or HIV disease from occurring. Etravirine will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who take this medicine may continue to have other problems related to AIDS or HIV disease.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
