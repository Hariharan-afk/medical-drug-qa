Description:
Promethazine injection is used to relieve or prevent some types of allergy or allergic reactions. It works by preventing the effects of a substance called histamine, which is produced by the body. Histamine can cause itching, sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes. It can sometimes close up the bronchial tubes (air passages of the lungs) and make breathing difficult.

Promethazine is also used to prevent and control motion sickness, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. In addition, it may be used to help people go to sleep and control their pain or anxiety before or after surgery or other procedures.

Promethazine may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.

This medicine is only available with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of promethazine injection in the pediatric population. Use of promethazine injection is not recommended in children younger than 2 years of age because of the increased risk of respiratory depression. Caution should be used when this medicine is given to children 2 years of age and older.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of promethazine injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients may be more sensitive to the side effects of this medicine than in younger adults, and are more likely to have age-related heart or blood vessel disease or prostate problems, which may require an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving promethazine injection.
