Description:
Fesoterodine is used to treat bladder problems, including neurogenic detrusor overactivity and symptoms of an overactive bladder, such as incontinence (loss of bladder control), a strong need to urinate right away, or a frequent need to urinate. It works on the muscles of the bladder to increase the amount of urine your bladder can hold and prevent them from causing incontinence.

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.
