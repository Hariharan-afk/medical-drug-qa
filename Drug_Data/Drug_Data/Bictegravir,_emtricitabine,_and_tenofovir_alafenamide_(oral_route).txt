Description:
Bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide combination is used alone to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This medicine is usually given to patients who have yet to receive any medicine for their HIV infection or to patients to replace their current medicine provided that they meet certain requirements.

Bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide combination will not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS. It works by lowering the amount of HIV in the blood and will also help your immune system. This may help delay problems that are usually related to AIDS or HIV disease from occurring. This medicine will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have other problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
