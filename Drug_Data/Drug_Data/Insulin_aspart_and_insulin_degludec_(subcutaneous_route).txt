Description:
Insulin aspart is a fast-acting type of insulin. Insulin degludec is a long-acting type of insulin that works slowly, over about 24 hours. Insulin is one of many hormones that help the body turn the food we eat into energy. This is done by using the glucose (sugar) in the blood as quick energy. Also, insulin helps us store energy that we can use later. When you have diabetes mellitus, your body cannot make enough insulin or does not use insulin properly. This causes you to have too much sugar in your blood. Like other types of insulin, insulin aspart and insulin degludec combination is used to keep your blood sugar level close to normal.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.


Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of insulin aspart and insulin degludec combination in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 1 year of age.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of insulin aspart and insulin degludec combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have hypoglycemia, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving insulin aspart and insulin degludec combination.
