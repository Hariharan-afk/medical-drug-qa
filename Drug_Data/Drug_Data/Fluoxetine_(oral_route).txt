Description:
Fluoxetine is used to treat depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bulimia nervosa, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and panic disorder. It is also used together with olanzapine to treat depression that is part of bipolar disorder and treatment resistant depression in patients who have received at least 2 previous treatments but did not work well.

Fluoxetine is an antidepressant and belongs to a group of medicines known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This medicine works by increasing the activity of a chemical called serotonin in the brain.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Capsule, Delayed Release
-> Syrup

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fluoxetine in children. However, safety and efficacy have not been established to treat  depression  in children younger than 8 years of age, to treat  obsessive-compulsive disorder  in children younger than 7 years of age, and to treat  depression that is part of bipolar disorder  in children younger than 10 years of age.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of fluoxetine in children with  bulimia nervosa ,  panic disorder , or  treatment resistant depression . Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fluoxetine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have hyponatremia (low sodium in the blood) than younger adults, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving fluoxetine.
