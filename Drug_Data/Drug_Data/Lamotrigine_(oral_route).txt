Description:
Lamotrigine is used alone or together with other medicines to help control certain types of seizures (eg, partial seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) in the treatment of epilepsy. This medicine cannot cure epilepsy and will only work to control seizures for as long as you continue to take it. It can also be used in the treatment of bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness) in adults.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet
-> Tablet, Extended Release
-> Tablet, Chewable
-> Tablet, Disintegrating

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of lamotrigine  chewable tablets, disintegrating tablets, tablets for suspension, or tablets  in children with certain types of seizures 2 years of age and older. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 2 years of age.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of lamotrigine  extended-release tablets  in children with partial seizures younger than 13 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of lamotrigine  chewable tablets, disintegrating tablets, tablets for suspension, or tablets  in children with bipolar disorder. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


Geriatric:
Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of lamotrigine have not been performed in the geriatric population, geriatric-specific problems are not expected to limit the usefulness of lamotrigine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving lamotrigine.


Breastfeeding:
There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.
