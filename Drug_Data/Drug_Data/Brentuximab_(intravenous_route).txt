Description:
Brentuximab injection is used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma, systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL), and primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL), which are blood cancers. It is given to patients who have received a bone marrow (autologous stem cell) transplant or other cancer treatments that did not work well.

Brentuximab injection is also used together with other cancer medicines (eg, doxorubicin, vinblastine, vincristine, dacarbazine, etoposide, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide) to treat a previously untreated high risk or stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma.

Brentuximab injection is also used together with other medicines (eg, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisone) to treat patients with previously untreated sALCL or other CD30-expressing peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL), including angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and PTCL not otherwise specified (NOS).

Brentuximab injection is also used together with other medicines (eg, lenalidomide, rituximab) to treat certain types of large B-cell lymphoma (including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL] not otherwise specified [NOS], DLBCL arising from indolent lymphoma, and high-grade B-cell lymphoma [HGBL]) that has come back or did not respond to previous treatment in patients who have received 2 or more treatments that did not work well and who are not able to receive auto-HSCT or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy.

Brentuximab interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are then destroyed by the body.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.
