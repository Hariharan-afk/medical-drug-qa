This medicine is also used to treat blepharospasm, a condition wherein the eyelid will not stay open because of a muscle spasm. It is also used to treat long-lasting sialorrhea (excessive drooling). IncobotulinumtoxinA is also used cosmetically to improve the appearance of upper facial lines or wrinkles (including glabellar lines, horizontal forehead lines, and lateral canthal lines) for a short period of time.

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of incobotulinumtoxinA in children with  lower limb spasticity, cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, or upper facial lines . Safety and efficacy have not been established.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of incobotulinumtoxinA in children 2 to 17 years of age with  sialorrhea or upper limb spasms, excluding spasms caused by cerebral palsy . Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 2 years of age.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of incobotulinumtoxinA in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of this medicine than younger adults and are more likely to have side effects (eg, difficulty with swallowing, lack or loss of strength, or dizziness), which may require caution in patients receiving incobotulinumtoxinA.
