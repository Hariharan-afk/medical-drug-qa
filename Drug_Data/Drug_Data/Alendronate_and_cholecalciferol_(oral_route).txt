Proper Use:

Take this medicine with a full glass (6 to 8 ounces) of  plain water  on an empty stomach.  It should be taken as soon as you get out of bed in the morning and at least 30 minutes before any food, beverage, or other medicines .

Medicines such as antacids, calcium, or vitamin supplements will also decrease the absorption of alendronate and cholecalciferol combination.

Swallow the tablet whole. Do not suck or chew on the tablet because it may cause throat irritation.

Do not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking this medicine and before having your first food for the day . This will help the medicine reach your stomach faster. It will also help prevent irritation to your esophagus.

It is important that you eat a well-balanced diet with adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D (found in milk or other dairy products). However, do not take any foods, beverages, or calcium supplements within 30 minutes or longer after taking this medicine. To do so may keep this medicine from working properly.
