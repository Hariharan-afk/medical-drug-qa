Description:
Hepatitis A vaccine is used to prevent infection caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV). The vaccine works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.

Hepatitis A is a serious disease of the liver that can cause death. It is caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV), and is spread most often through infected food or water. Hepatitis A may also be spread by close person-to-person contact with infected persons (such as between persons living in the same household). Although some infected persons do not appear to be sick, they are still able to spread the virus to others.

Hepatitis A is less common in the U.S. and other areas of the world that have a higher level of sanitation and good water and sewage (waste) systems. However, it is a significant health problem in parts of the world that do not have such systems. If you are traveling to certain countries or remote (out-of-the-way) areas, hepatitis A vaccine will help protect you from hepatitis A disease.

It is recommended that adults and children 12 months of age and older to be vaccinated with hepatitis A vaccine when traveling to the following parts of the world:

-> Africa.
-> Asia (except Japan).
-> Parts of the Caribbean.
-> Central and South America.
-> Eastern Europe.
-> The Mediterranean basin.
-> The Middle East.
-> Mexico.
Immunization against hepatitis A disease is also recommended for adults and children 12 months of age and older who live in areas that have a high rate of hepatitis A disease or who may be at increased risk of infection from hepatitis A virus. These persons include:

-> Military personnel.
-> Persons living in or moving to areas that have a high rate of HAV infection.
-> Persons who may be exposed to the hepatitis A virus repeatedly due to a high rate of hepatitis A disease, such as Alaskan Eskimos and Native Americans.
-> Males who have sex with males.
-> Persons who use illegal injection drugs.
-> Persons living in a community experiencing an outbreak of hepatitis A.
-> Employees of facilities for persons with an intellectual disability.
-> Employees of child day-care centers.
-> Persons who work with hepatitis A virus in the laboratory.
-> Persons who handle primate animals.
-> Persons with hemophilia.
-> Food handlers.
