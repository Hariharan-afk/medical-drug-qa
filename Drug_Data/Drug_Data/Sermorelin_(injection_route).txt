Description:
Sermorelin is a synthetic (man-made) version of a naturally occurring substance that causes release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland. Growth hormone is naturally produced by the pituitary gland and is necessary for growth in children. In children who fail to grow normally because their bodies are not producing enough growth hormone, this medicine may be used to increase the amount of growth hormone produced by the pituitary gland.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.


Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Breastfeeding:
There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.


Drug Interactions:
Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.


Other Interactions:
Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.  Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.  Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.


Other Medical Problems:
The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

-> Underactive thyroid—This condition can interfere with the effects of sermorelin

Proper Use:
If you are injecting this medicine yourself, use it exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not use more or less of it, and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. The exact amount of medicine needed has been carefully worked out. Using too much will increase the risk of side effects, while using too little may not improve the condition.

Each package of sermorelin contains a patient instruction sheet. Read this sheet carefully and make sure you understand:

-> How to give the injection.
-> How long the injection is safe to use.
It is best to use a different place on the body for each injection (for example, abdomen, hip, thigh, or upper arm). To help you remember to do this, you may want to keep a record of the date and location for each injection.

The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.

The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.
