Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines.

For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of gallium Ga 68 dotatoc injection in children.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of gallium Ga 68 dotatoc injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have heart, kidney, or liver problems, which may require caution in patients receiving gallium Ga 68 dotatoc injection.
