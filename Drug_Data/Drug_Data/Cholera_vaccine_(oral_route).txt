Description:
Cholera vaccine is used in adults to help prevent cholera. Cholera is a serious disease that can cause death. It is caused by a germ called Vibrio cholerae, and is spread most often through infected food or water. If you are traveling to cholera-infected areas, avoid eating uncooked food, especially fish and shellfish, and peel fruit yourself. Avoid water that may be infected, carbonated bottled water and carbonated soft drinks are safe.

Cholera is rare in the U.S. and other areas of the world that have good water and sewage (waste) systems. However, it is a problem in parts of the world that do not have such systems. If you are traveling to cholera-infected areas (eg, developing countries of Africa, Asia, and Latin America) cholera vaccine may help protect you from cholera. It is very important to avoid infected persons and food and water that may be infected, even if you have received the vaccine.

This vaccine is to be given only by or under the supervision of a doctor.
