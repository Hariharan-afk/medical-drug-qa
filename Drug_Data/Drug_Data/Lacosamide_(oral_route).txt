Lacosamide is used to treat partial-onset seizures. It is also used with other medicines to treat primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to reduce the number and severity of seizures. However, this medicine cannot cure epilepsy and will only work to control seizures for as long as you continue to take it.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet
-> Solution
