Description:
Meningococcal vaccine is an active immunizing agent used to prevent infection caused by certain groups of meningococcal bacteria ( Neisseria meningitides ). The vaccine works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.

Bexsero®  and  Trumenba®  is active against group B meningococcal bacteria only.

Meningococcal infection can cause life-threatening illnesses, such as meningococcal meningitis, which affects the brain, and meningococcemia, which affects the blood. Some persons with meningococcal meningitis and/or meningococcemia also may die. These diseases are more likely to occur in young children and in persons with certain diseases or conditions that make them more susceptible to a meningococcal infection or more likely to develop serious problems from a meningococcal infection.

Immunization against meningococcal disease is recommended for persons who are at risk of getting the disease because:

-> They have certain diseases or conditions that make them more susceptible to a meningococcal infection or more likely to develop serious problems from a meningococcal infection.
-> They are living in, working in, or visiting an area where there is a strong possibility of contracting meningococcal disease.
Bexsero®  and  Trumenba®  is recommended for use in patients 10 to 25 years of age.

This vaccine is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor.
