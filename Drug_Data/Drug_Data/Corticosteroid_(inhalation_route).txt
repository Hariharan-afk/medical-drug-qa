Description:
Inhalation corticosteroids are cortisone-like medicines. They are used to help prevent the symptoms of asthma. When used regularly every day, inhalation corticosteroids decrease the number and severity of asthma attacks. However, they will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.

Inhaled corticosteroids work by preventing certain cells in the lungs and breathing passages from releasing substances that cause asthma symptoms.

This medicine may be used with other asthma medicines, such as bronchodilators (medicines that open up narrowed breathing passages) or other corticosteroids taken by mouth.

Inhalation corticosteroids are available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Aerosol Liquid
-> Powder
-> Aerosol Powder
-> Suspension

Before Using:

Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Inhalation corticosteroids have been tested in children and, except for the possibility of slowed growth, in low effective doses, have not been shown to cause different side effects or problems than they do in adults.

Studies have shown that slowed growth or reduced adrenal gland function may occur in some children using inhaled corticosteroids in recommended doses. However, poorly controlled asthma may cause slowed growth, especially when corticosteroids taken by mouth are needed. Your doctor will want you to use the lowest possible dose of an inhaled corticosteroid that will control the asthma. This will lessen the chance of an effect on growth or adrenal gland function.  It is also important that children taking inhaled corticosteroids visit their doctors regularly so that their growth rates may be monitored.

Regular use of inhaled corticosteroids may allow some children to stop using or decrease the amount of corticosteroids taken by mouth. This also will reduce the risk of slowed growth or reduced adrenal function.

Children who are using inhaled corticosteroids in large doses should avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles. When a child is exposed or the disease develops, the doctor should be contacted and his or her directions should be followed carefully.

Before this medicine is given to a child, you and your child's doctor should talk about the good this medicine will do as well as the risks of using it. Follow the doctor's directions very carefully to lessen the chance that unwanted effects will occur.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of inhaled corticosteroids have not been performed in the geriatric population. However, no geriatric-specific problems have been documented to date.


Pregnancy:
Although studies in animals have shown that inhaled corticosteroids cause birth defects and other problems, in humans these medicines, when used in regular daily doses during pregnancy to keep the mother's asthma under control, have not been reported to cause breathing problems or birth defects in the newborn. Also, corticosteroids may prevent the effects of poorly controlled asthma, which are known to be harmful to the baby.  Before taking an inhaled corticosteroid, make sure your doctor knows if you are pregnant or if you may become pregnant.


Breastfeeding:
It is not known whether inhaled corticosteroids pass into breast milk. Although most medicines pass into breast milk in small amounts, many of them may be used safely while breast-feeding. Mothers who are using this medicine and who wish to breast-feed should discuss this with their doctor.


Drug Interactions:
Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.


Other Interactions:
Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.  Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.  Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.


Other Medical Problems:
The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of medicines in this class. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

-> Asthma attack, acute (e.g., status asthmaticus)—Triamcinolone should not be used in patients with this condition.
-> Cirrhosis (liver disease)—The effect of inhaled corticosteroids may be stronger in patients with this disease
-> Glaucoma—Use with caution. May increase the pressure in the eye.
-> Hypothyroidism (decreased production of thyroid hormone)—The effect of inhaled corticosteroids may be stronger in patients with this condition.
-> Infections, untreated (bacteria, fungal, or viral)—Use with caution. May make this condition worse.
-> Osteoporosis (bone disease)—Inhaled corticosteroids in high doses may make this condition worse in women who are past menopause and who are not receiving an estrogen replacement.
-> Tuberculosis, history of—Use of this medicine may cause a tuberculosis infection to occur again.

Proper Use:
Inhaled corticosteroids will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started. However, your doctor may want you to continue taking this medicine at the usual time, even if you use another medicine to relieve the asthma attack.

Use this medicine only as directed. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of side effects. Do not stop taking this medicine abruptly. This medicine should be discontinued only under the supervision of your doctor.

In order for this medicine to help prevent asthma attacks, it must be used every day in regularly spaced doses, as ordered by your doctor . Up to 4 to 6 weeks may pass before you begin to notice improvement in your condition. It may take several months before you feel the full effects of this medicine. This may not take as long if you have already been taking certain other medicines for your asthma.

Gargling and rinsing your mouth with water after each dose may help prevent hoarseness, throat irritation, and infection in the mouth. However, do not swallow the water after rinsing. Your doctor may also want you to use a spacer device to lessen these problems.

Inhaled corticosteroids are used with a special inhaler and usually come with patient directions.  Read the directions carefully before using this medicine . If you do not understand the directions or you are not sure how to use the inhaler, ask your health care professional to show you what to do. Also,  ask your health care professional to watch how you use the inhaler to make sure you are using it properly .

For patients using  beclomethasone, flunisolide, or triamcinolone inhalation aerosol :

-> When you use the inhaler for the first time, or if you have not used it in a while, it may not deliver the right amount of medicine with the first puff. So, before using the inhaler, test or prime it.
-> To test or prime most inhalers: Insert the metal canister firmly into the clean mouthpiece according to the manufacturer's instructions. Check to make sure the canister is placed properly into the mouthpiece. Take the cover off the mouthpiece and shake the inhaler three or four times. Hold the inhaler well away from you at arm's length and press the top of the canister, spraying the medicine into the air two times. The inhaler will now be ready to provide the right amount of medicine when you use it.
-> To use most inhalers: Using your thumb and one or two fingers, hold the inhaler upright with the mouthpiece end down and pointing toward you. Take the cover off the mouthpiece. Check the mouthpiece and remove any foreign objects. Then gently shake the inhaler three or four times. Hold the mouthpiece away from your mouth and breathe out slowly to the end of a normal breath. Use the inhalation method recommended by your doctor: Open-mouth method—Place the mouthpiece about 1 or 2 inches (2 finger widths) in front of your widely opened mouth. Make sure the inhaler is aimed into your mouth so that the spray does not hit the roof of your mouth or your tongue. Closed-mouth method—Place the mouthpiece in your mouth between your teeth and over your tongue with your lips closed tightly around it. Do not block the mouthpiece with your teeth or tongue. Start to breathe in slowly through your mouth and, at the same time, press the top of the canister one time to get 1 puff of medicine. Continue to breathe in slowly for 3 to 5 seconds. Count the seconds while inhaling. It is important to press the top of the canister and breathe in slowly at the same time so the medicine gets into your lungs. This step may be difficult at first. If you are using the closed-mouth method and you see a fine mist coming from your mouth or nose, the inhaler is not being used correctly. Hold your breath as long as you can up to 10 seconds. This gives the medicine time to settle in your airways and lungs. Take the mouthpiece away from your mouth and breathe out slowly. If your doctor has told you to inhale more than 1 puff of medicine at each dose, gently shake the inhaler again, and take the next puff, following exactly the same steps you used for the first puff. Press the canister one time for each puff of medicine. When you are finished, wipe off the mouthpiece and replace the cap. Your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist may want you to use a spacer device with the inhaler. A spacer helps get the medicine into the lungs and reduces the amount of medicine that stays in your mouth and throat. To use a spacer device with the inhaler: Attach the spacer to the inhaler according to the manufacturer's directions. There are different types of spacers available, but the method of breathing remains the same with most spacers. Gently shake the inhaler and spacer three or four times. Hold the mouthpiece of the spacer away from your mouth and breathe out slowly to the end of a normal breath. Place the mouthpiece into your mouth between your teeth and over your tongue with your lips closed around it. Press down on the canister top once to release 1 puff of medicine into the spacer. Within one or two seconds, start to breathe in slowly through your mouth for 3 to 5 seconds. Count the seconds while inhaling. Do not breathe in through your nose. Hold your breath as long as you can up to 10 seconds. Breathe out slowly. Do not remove the mouthpiece from your mouth. Breathe in and out slowly two or three times to make sure the spacer device is emptied. If your doctor has told you to take more than 1 puff of medicine at each dose, gently shake the inhaler and spacer again and take the next puff, following exactly the same steps you used for the first puff. Do not spray more than 1 puff at a time into the spacer. When you are finished, remove the spacer device from the inhaler and replace the cover of the mouthpiece. Clean the inhaler mouthpiece, and spacer at least once a week. To clean the inhaler: Remove the canister from the inhaler and set the canister aside. Wash the mouthpiece, cap, and spacer with warm, soapy water. Then, rinse well with warm, running water. Shake off the excess water and let the inhaler parts air-dry completely before putting the inhaler back together. Check with your pharmacist to see if you should save the inhaler piece that comes with this medicine after the medicine is used up. Refill units may be available at a lower cost. However, remember that the inhaler is meant to be used only for the medicine that comes with it. Do not use the inhaler for any other inhalation aerosol medicine, even if the cartridge fits.
