Description:
Pregabalin is used with other medicines to help control partial-onset seizures (convulsions) in the treatment of epilepsy in patients 1 month of age and older. This medicine will not cure epilepsy and will only work to control seizures for as long as you continue to take it.

Pregabalin is also used for postherpetic neuralgia (pain that occurs after shingles) and pain caused by nerve damage from diabetes or a spinal cord injury.

Pregabalin  capsule  and  oral liquid  are also used to treat a condition called fibromyalgia (muscle pain and stiffness).

Pregabalin works in the central nervous system (CNS) to control seizures and pain. It is an anticonvulsant and neuropathic pain agent.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Capsule
-> Tablet, Extended Release
-> Solution

Before Using:
In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:


Allergies:
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.


Pediatric:
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of pregabalin  capsules and oral liquid  in children younger than 1 month of age for partial onset seizures and  extended-release tablets  in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established for other conditions.


Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of pregabalin in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted effects (eg, dizziness, blurred vision, confusion, or clumsiness) and age-related kidney problems, which may require an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving pregabalin.

There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.
