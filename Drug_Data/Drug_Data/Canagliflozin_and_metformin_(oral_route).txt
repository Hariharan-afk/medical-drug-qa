Description:
Canagliflozin and metformin combination is used together with proper diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes. This medicine is also used to lower the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death in patients with type 2 diabetes and heart or blood vessel disease. This medicine is also used to lower the risk of end stage kidney disease, worsening of kidney function, and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease with a certain amount of protein in the urine.

Canagliflozin works in the kidneys to prevent absorption of glucose (blood sugar). This helps lower the blood sugar level. Metformin reduces the absorption of sugar from the stomach, reduces the release of stored sugar from the liver, and helps your body use sugar better. It does not help patients who have insulin-dependent or type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetic patients must use insulin injections.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

-> Tablet, Extended Release
-> Tablet

Before Using:

Geriatric:
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of canagliflozin and metformin combination in the elderly.
