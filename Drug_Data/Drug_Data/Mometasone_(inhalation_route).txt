Description:
Mometasone is used to help prevent the symptoms of asthma and improve breathing. When used regularly every day, inhaled mometasone decreases the number and severity of asthma attacks. However, it will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.

Inhaled mometasone belongs to the family of medicines known as corticosteroids (cortisone-like medicines). It works by preventing certain cells in the lungs and breathing passages from releasing substances that cause asthma symptoms.
