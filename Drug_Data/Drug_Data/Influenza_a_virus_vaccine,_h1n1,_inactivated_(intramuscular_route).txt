Description:
Influenza virus vaccine, H1N1 is used to prevent infection caused by the influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus. The vaccine works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. It is also known as a "flu shot".

Influenza is a virus infection of the throat, bronchial tubes, and lungs. Influenza infection causes fever, chills, cough, headache, muscle aches, and pains in your back, arms, and legs. In addition, adults and children weakened by other diseases or medical conditions, and persons 50 years of age and over, even if they are healthy, may get a much more serious illness that may have to be treated in a hospital. Each year thousands of people die as a result of an influenza infection.
