Proper Use:

Treatment with porfimer and laser light occurs in three steps. First, the porfimer is injected into your body. Second, about 2 days later, a laser light is directed at the cancer. Then, about 2 or 3 days after the light is applied, your doctor will remove the cancer cells that have been destroyed.


Precautions:
It is very important that your doctor check you at regular visits  for any problems or unwanted effects that may be caused by this medicine.

Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant during treatment and for at least 5 months after your last dose. Males who are receiving this medicine, with female partners who can become pregnant must use effective birth control during and for at least 5 months after the last dose of this medicine. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.

For at least 30 days after you receive an injection of porfimer, your eyes will be extra sensitive to light, including sunlight, bright indoor lights, and vehicle headlights. Certain types of sunglasses can help protect your eyes during this time. Check with your doctor about which sunglasses to use.

For at least 30 days after you receive an injection of porfimer, your skin will be extra sensitive to sunlight and to very bright indoor lights, such as lamps with unshaded light bulbs and lights in dental offices or operating rooms. Do not expose your skin to direct sunlight or to bright indoor lights during this time. Sunscreens will not protect your skin from a severe reaction to light (blistering, burning, and swelling of the skin). However, exposure to normal amounts of indoor light (eg, daylight or light from lamps with shades) will help use up the porfimer remaining in your skin. Therefore, do not protect your skin from normal amounts of indoor light. If you have any questions about whether the light in your home is too bright, check with your doctor or nurse. Also, ask your doctor or nurse ahead of time about what you should do if a severe reaction to light occurs.

Thirty days after receiving an injection of porfimer, test a small portion of your skin by exposing it to sunlight for 10 minutes. (Do not test skin on your face.) If the exposed part of your skin does not become blistered, red, or swollen during the next 24 hours, you can slowly increase your exposure to sunlight and bright indoor lights. If a reaction does occur, wait another 2 weeks, then test your sensitivity to sunlight again.

Even after your skin and eyes are no longer sensitive to the lights in your home or the amount of sunlight in the area where you live, you may still be sensitive to brighter levels of light. If you travel to an area where the sunlight is stronger than at home, test yourself again before exposing your skin to the stronger light.

You might have pain around your chest after your treatment. If you have pain, talk with your doctor about the best way to treat it.

If you are using this medicine to treat Barrett's esophagus, your chance of having narrowing of the esophagus may be increased. Check with your doctor right away if you start to have trouble with swallowing after you have received this medicine.

Blood clotting problems may occur in patients after receiving this medicine. Check with your doctor if you have pain in the chest, groin, or legs, especially the calves, difficulty with breathing, severe, sudden headache, slurred speech, sudden, unexplained shortness of breath, sudden loss of coordination, sudden, severe weakness or numbness in the arm or leg, or vision changes.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
